# Compiled by:

# Default sequence implementation.
# Currently, red_black_numbered_list is our preferred
# -- and only -- implementation of Sequence, but
# that might change:

package sequence
    =
    red_black_numbered_list;				# red_black_numbered_list	is from   src/lib/src/red-black-numbered-list.pkg
