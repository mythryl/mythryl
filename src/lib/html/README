This library provides support for parsing and pretty-printing HTML.
The file html.api and html.pkg define a parse-tree representation
of HTML 3.2 (as defined in the January 14th 1997 specification).

The html package implements a collection of uniontypes
that describe the syntax of HTML trees according to the 3.2 spec.
The library provides support for parsing and printing these
uniontypes.  The package macro html_parser_g implements the parser and
the prettyprint_html_tree package provides printing of HTML trees.  Also, there
is a package called make_html, which provides helper functions for
constructing HTML trees (mostly defaults of attribute values).

Note that this is a fairly strict interpretation of the standard;
non-standard tags and attributes will cause errors.  To allow some
flexibility, the parser is genericized over a collection of error
reporting functions (see html-error.api).

The file test-parser.pkg gives an example of how the parser part of the
library can be used.

TODO LIST:

The parser has trouble with white-space in the <HEAD>.

The pretty-printer needs to be rewritten to deal with line breaks better.

Some library support for entities (e.g., "&lt;" should be provided).
