# Compiled by:

# This is the base-library Time package with only the time type, so that the
# base-libraries APIs can compile.  It has to be in a separate file from
# pre-basis-structs.sml, since it depends on the naming of large_int.

package time {
    #
    Time = TIME  { usec:  large_int::Int };		# large_int	is from   src/lib/std/types-only/bind-largest32.pkg
