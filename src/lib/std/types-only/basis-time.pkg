## basis-time.pkg

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/std/types-only/types-only.sublib

# This is the base-library Time package with only the time type, so that the
# base-libraries APIs can compile.  It has to be in a separate file from
# pre-basis-structs.sml, since it depends on the definition of large_int.
