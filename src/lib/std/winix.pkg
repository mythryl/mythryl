# This library gives access to basic OS functionality
# common to both Windows and POSIX -- hence the name.
#
# Applications written to use this interface can run
# unchanged on Windows, Mac OSX, Linux and *BSD.
#
# The price, of course, is being limited to just
# lowest-common-denominator functionality.
#
# For richer POSIX and Windows interfaces, see respectively
