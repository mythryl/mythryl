#
#                 "It is said, with reason, that you may know
#                  the workman by his tools.
#
#                 "Independence is the sin qua non of creativity.
#
#                 "The essential difference between the true hacker and
#                  the drone programmer is that the true hacker breaks new
#                  ground, making computers do things they have never
#                  done before.
#
#                 "You will invariably break your tools when you do
#                  such work.  Thus, the hacker, like the traditional
#                  Swiss watchmaker, must be able to adapt or create his
#                  own tools as he goes along.
#
#                 "This is why C was born with Unix:  It took a new
#                  language and new compiler to express new thoughts.
#
#                 "If you can't strip down  and rebuild your compiler
#                  over a weekend, your range of possible achievement
#                  as a hacker will be severely limited.
#
#                 "Open source tools make this degree of control possible.
#
#                 "But only extended study motivated by a deep love of the
#                  art can make it a reality."
