# Compiled by:

# This is a hook for the top-level print function, which allows
# it to be rebound.


#  Imported from Init/print-hook.pkg via the "print-hook" primitive. 
/* In its original state it is uninitialized because it is defined at a
 * time when the IO stack is not yet available.  That's why we do an
 * assignment here.  (The bootstrap mechanism must make sure that this
 * code actually gets executed...) */
