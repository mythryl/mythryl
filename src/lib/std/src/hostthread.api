# hostthread.api
#
# [ This is a low-level interface;  Mythryl application programmers  
#   in search of concurrency should use threadkit instead.  
# 
#   The hostthread library is intended mainly as support for library bindings 
#   to  Gtk, OpenGL and the like, so that they can block their own  
#   hostthread without stopping threadkit execution dead in the water. 
# 
#   It might also be useful for gaining parallelism in CPU-intensive 
#   apps like mandelbrot-set viewers or raytracers or such. 
# 
#   hostthread is a minefield of potential deadlocks, race conditions and  
#   datastructure corruption, so it should be used only when absolutely  
#   needed, and then only as minimally, simply and carefully as practical.
