## winix-base-text-file-io-driver-for-posix--premicrothread.pkg
#
# Here we implement posix-specific text file I/O support.  
#
# On Linux/unix the main distinction between 'text'
# and 'binary' file I/O is that the former treats
# files as streams of Char values, while the latter treats
# them as streams of eight-bit unsigned integer values.
#
# This file gets used in:
