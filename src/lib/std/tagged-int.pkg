## tagged-int.pkg
#
# Tagged ints have a 1 in the low bit, to let the
# heapcleaner ("garbage collector") distinguish them
# from pointers (which always have 2-3 zero bits at
# the low end due to heap objects being word-aligned).
#
# This low-bit 1 is not directly visible to the
# application programmer, but because the low bit
# is fixed to 1, tagged ints have one less usable
# bit than untagged ints:
#   31 useful bits on 32-bit implementations,
#   63 useful bits on 64-bit implementations.

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/std/standard.lib
