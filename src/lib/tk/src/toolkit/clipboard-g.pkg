# ***************************************************************************
# The clipboard is used to exchange objects between different drag&drop
# canvases or other manipulation areas. 
# **************************************************************************


# In the following Tk_Events are used to certify events, to make sure
# that only matching pairs of objects are put/got. That ensures that
# an object can only be got from the clibboard if it it has been put
# there with the same mouse event-- in other words, you don't drop
# your object somewhere, take the mouse around the screen for an
# extended tour, and finally two hours later end up in another window
# with still something in the clipboard.  The second argument to put
# is a "callback" function which is executed once the object has been
# successfully taken out of the clipboard with the get function; an 
# example here would be to  delete the object in the old window once
# it has appeared elswhere. The "copy" function does the same as get,
# except it _doesn't_ call the callback function, allowing eg. the copying
# of the object in the clipboard. Of course, the object disappears from
# the clipboard.
#
# You can imagine a more generic version of this parameterized with 
# type stamp eq:  stamp -> stamp -> Bool but then what would be the use
# of that and it would make debugging mair complicated an' aw.
#
# There are two additional sub-apis of Clipboard given, which you can
# use to coerce to clipboard to being read-only or write-only (i.e. you 
# can only get things or put things)
