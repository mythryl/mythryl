# This file defines the compiler back-end

# (On x86-win32, x86-win32-compiler-client-interface.pkg is used instead.)

# The standard compiler references us via

#     src/lib/core/compiler/x86-with-unix-call-conventions.pkg

    # Eventually we need to generate separate binaries for the
    # IntelMac platform.  This code figures out dynamically
    # whether it is running Darwin (i.e., Mac OS X on an Intel),
    # but this does not work correctly when cross-compiling.
    # In particular, once the compiler or any of the libraries
    # that get compiled by the cross-compiler starts using NLFFI,
    # then things will start to break.
    #
    # Also, the cross-compiler will not set the ABI_Darwin symbol
    # correctly for CM's conditional compilation mechanism, so the
    # compiler sources cannot rely on it!
