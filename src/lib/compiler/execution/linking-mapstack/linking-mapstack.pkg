## linking-mapstack.pkg

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/compiler/execution/execute.sublib


# The linking table is maintained and used by
# the linker, and records the linkage-level information
# of interest to it, primarily information about the
# linkable values exported by compiled source files
# -- "compiled_files".
#
# The linking dictionary contains one entry per compiledfile.
#
# Each entry's key is the 16-byte exports Picklehash
# of that compiledfile.
#
# Each entry's value is a record indexed by selectors,
# listing the stuff exported by that compiledfile.
#
# Since each record entry may in itself be
# a record, in general we access stuff in the
# linking dictionary by first looking up some
# export pick_hash identifying the desired compiledfile,
# then doing successive selections down some path
# of record selectors until we arrive at the
# actual desired datum.
