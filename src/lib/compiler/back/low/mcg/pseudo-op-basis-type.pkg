		  #	
		  # ALIGN_SIZE aligns on a 2^n boundary.
		  #
		  # ALIGN_ENTRY forces alignment on an instruction cache line 
		  # boundary, and ALIGN_LABEL is used for internal labels 
		  # (such as loops) and may only align if a small (architecture 
		  # determined) number of nops are required 



	  | DATA_LABEL  lbl::Codelabel
		  #
		  # Labels for data pseudo-ops.
		  # Code labels should not be generated as pseudo-ops.

	  | DATA_READ_ONLY						# Read-only initialized data.
	  | DATA 							# Initialized data.
	  | BSS								# All-zero data.
	  | TEXT							# Executable code.
	  | SECTION  qs::Quickstring 
		  #
		  # The usual text and data sections. 
		  # Sections are not allowed inside a text segment 


	  | REORDER
	  | NOREORDER
		  #
		  # May have to rethink this one!
		  # For now, all instructions following a NOREORDER pseudo-op
		  # are preserved in the order they were generated, until 
		  # a REORDER pseudo-op is seen.
		  #
		  # Perhaps what we also want a BARRIER pseudo-op that says
		  # no instructions must be moved above or below the barrier.
