\section{Introduction}
If you are like me, you lament the fact that SML doesn't have conditional
pattern matching.  Personally, I don't fully understand the rationale for its
omission in the standard--- even though there are semantics ambiguity 
issues if guard expressions have side effects, conditional pattern matching
is just too useful in practice.   When writing non-trivial transformations, I
find myself having to manually factor pattern matching code, 
whose job should be the compiler's.
I consider its lack in SML a big flaw in an otherwise great language.

  As a remedy, \nowhere{} is a simple source to source tool that translates
SML programs augmented with where-clauses and other complex patterns
into normal SML code, i.e., code without where-clauses\footnote{Thus the name of the tool.}.  

\subsection{Syntax}
Where-clauses that we recognize are of two forms.
In case statements:
\begin{alltt}
    \(pat\) \WHERE \(exp\) => \(exp\)
\end{alltt}
and in function clauses:
\begin{alltt}
    \(pat\sb{1}\) \ldots \(pat\sb{n}\) \WHERE (\(exp\)) = \(exp\)
\end{alltt}
Note that parentheses are not optional in the latter form, because
of syntactic ambiguity with \verb|=|.

For example, the expression
\begin{alltt}
   \CASE [1,2,3] \OF 
      [x,y,z] \WHERE x>y \AND y>z => 1
    | [x,y,z] \WHERE x<y \AND y<z => 2
    | _ => 3
\end{alltt}
evaluates to 2.

\Nowhere{} takes input files of the following form:
\begin{alltt}
{\bf local}
    {\sl enum definitions prologue}
{\bf in}
    {\sl code}
{\bf end}
\end{alltt}
It looks for where-clauses within the {\sl code} section, and rewrite it into
real SML code.  The {\sl prologue} section is for the benefit
of \nowhere, since it is rather stupid at the moment and doesn't understand
SML's scoping rule and environments.  
All uniontypes that are used within the {\sl code}
section should be mentioned here, so that \nowhere{} can find its definitions.

You can use the special file import declaration:
\begin{alltt}
  {\bf include} "filename"
\end{alltt}
to import the definitions from a file.  Note that \nowhere{} will look 
inside api definitions.  So if all uniontypes are
properly defined in api files, all you have to do is import these
files.

\subsection{A Note on Semantics}
   Expressions evaluated inside where-clauses should be side-effect free.
This is a built-in assumption in the match compiler.  If it is violated
the result may not be as expected. 

\subsection{Other Extensions in Version 1.1}

  Aside from the standard set of SML patterns and where-clauses, 
the following extensions are also handled:
\subsubsection{OR-patterns}   OR-patterns are written as
\begin{alltt}
   (\(pat\sb{1}\) | \ldots | \(pat\sb{n}\))
\end{alltt}
Note that the parenthesis are {\em not} optional.  A rule such as:
\begin{alltt}
   (\(pat\sb{1}\) | \ldots | \(pat\sb{n}\)) => e
\end{alltt}
means the same thing as
\begin{alltt}
   \(pat\sb{1}\) => e
     \vdots
   \(pat\sb{n}\) => e
\end{alltt}
The semantics of OR-patterns are identical to the treatment in the compiler.
In particular, all disjuncts must have the same set of pattern variables
and each variable must have the same type in all occurrances in the OR-pattern. 

\subsubsection{NOT-patterns} NOT patterns negate the meaning of a pattern.
The general syntax is
\begin{alltt}
   \NOT \(pat\)
\end{alltt}
For example, a pattern \verb|not p|, only matches forms other than \verb|p|.
Note that the namings of a NOT pattern are not visible, for obvious reasons.

\subsubsection{WHERE-patterns} WHERE-patterns modifies a pattern by adding
a condition.  For example, the pattern
\begin{alltt}
    ([x,y,z] \WHERE x<y \AND y<z)
\end{alltt}
matches only lists of length 3 listed in increasing order.   
WHERE-pattern can be seen as a simple generalization
of where-clauses.  The general syntax of a WHERE-pattern is:
\begin{alltt}
    (\(pat\) \WHERE \(exp\))
\end{alltt}
Note that the parentheses are required.  Furthermore, $exp$ can only 
refer to pattern variables introduced in \(pat\).

Because WHERE-patterns can be nested in subpatterns, 
they are very useful when combined with other pattern connectives.
For example, the pattern
\begin{alltt}
    \NOT ([x,y,z] \WHERE x<y \AND y<z)
\end{alltt}
matches all integer lists {\em except} lists of length 3 listed in increasing order.  

\subsubsection{Nested patterns} Nested patterns allow conditional case statements to
be embedded in a pattern.  They are written as\footnote{This syntax may be 
changed in future versions.}:
\begin{alltt}
   (\(pat\sb{1}\) \WHERE \(exp\) \IN \(pat\sb{2}\))
\end{alltt}
  The semantics is to match $pat_1$, and if it matches, evaluates
$exp$, and matches it with $pat_2$.  The entire pattern matches if
both $pat_1$ and $pat_2$ match.  Note that $exp$ may refer to pattern
variables introduced in $pat_1$, and the result of a successful match introduces
namings from both $pat_1$ and $pat_2$.

For example, the pattern
\begin{alltt}
  ((l as h . t) \WHERE list.last l \IN [x])
\end{alltt}   
matches only non-NIL lists of lists whose last element is a singleton.
Upon a successful match, pattern variables \verb|h|, 
\verb|t| and \verb|x| are bound to the appropriate values.

\subsubsection{Float and integer literals}
 Float and integer literal patterns are supported.
integer literals are written with the suffix \verb|i|.
For example, \verb|0i| is 0 (of type \verb|integer.Int|.)
Binary and hex prefixes can also be used.
For example, the literals \verb|0xffi|, \verb|0b11111111i|
and \verb|256i| mean the same thing.

\section{An Example}
Here's a larger example taken from the intel32 peephole phase in MLRISC.
We only show the push and pop folding rules.  The first rule
folds the instructions 
\begin{verbatim}
   subl 4, %esp
   movl src, 0(%esp)
\end{verbatim}
into \verb|push src|, assuming src is not \verb|%esp|. 
The second rule folds
\begin{verbatim}
   movl 0(%esp), dst
   addl 4, %esp
\end{verbatim}
into \verb|pop dst|, again assuming dst is not \verb|%esp|.

\begin{alltt}
\LOCAL\ 
   #  import instruction definition 
   \PACKAGE I = 
   \STRUCT
      include "machcode-intel32.sml" 
   \END
\IN\ 
   {\sl ... }
   \FUN loop(current, instrs) =
       \CASE current \OF
         {\sl ... }
      | I.BINARY\{binOp=I.SUBL, src=I.Immed 4, dst=I.Direct dst_i\} . 
        I.MOVE\{mv_op=I.MOVL,src,dst=I.Displace\{base,disp=I.Immed 0, ...\}\}
        . rest 
           \WHERE C.sameColor(base, C.esp) and
                  C.sameColor(dst_i, C.esp) and
                  not(isStackPtr src) =>
           loop(rest, I.PUSHL src . instrs)
               
      | I.MOVE\{mv_op=I.MOVL, 
              src=I.Displace\{base, disp=I.Immed 0, ...\}, dst\} .
        I.BINARY\{binOp=I.ADDL, src=I.Immed 4, dst=I.Direct dst_i\} . 
        rest 
           \WHERE C.sameColor(base, C.esp) and
                 C.sameColor(dst_i,C.esp) and
                 not(isStackPtr dst) =>
           loop(rest, I.POP dst . instrs)

     | i . rest => loop(rest, i . instrs)
     {\sl ... }
\END
\end{alltt}
where function \verb|isStackPtr| is defined as:
\begin{alltt}
  \FUN isStackPtr(I.Direct r) = C.sameColor(r,C.esp)
     | isStackPtr _ = false
\end{alltt}

The same set of rules may be written in many different ways.
For example, an alternative way of writing the push folding rule, using
WHERE-patterns and NOT-patterns, is:
\begin{alltt}
     I.BINARY\{binOp=I.SUBL, 
               src=I.Immed 4, 
               dst=(I.Direct dst \WHERE C.sameColor(dst,C.esp))
             \} . 
     I.MOVE\{mv_op=I.MOVL,
             src=\NOT (I.Direct src \WHERE C.sameColor(src,C.esp)),
             dst=I.Displace\{base \WHERE C.sameColor(base,C.esp),
                             disp=I.Immed 0, ...\}
           \}
     . rest 
        =>
         loop(rest, I.PUSHL src . instrs)
\end{alltt}
The labelled pattern 
\begin{alltt}
   base \WHERE C.sameColor(base,C.esp)
\end{alltt}
is an abbreviation for 
\begin{alltt}
   base=(base \WHERE C.sameColor(base,C.esp))
\end{alltt}

Note that since all constructors are accessed via the package \verb|I|
inside the body, 
the enum definitions are defined accordingly in the prologue.
\begin{alltt}
   \PACKAGE I = 
   \STRUCT
      include "machcode-intel32.sml" 
   \END
\end{alltt}

\section{Compiling and Running the Tool}

To compile the tool, go to the directory Tools/WhereGen, and in sml, type
\begin{alltt}
   use "build.pkg"
\end{alltt}
When this completes, the image \verb|nowhere.<arch>| will be generated.

The input files to \nowhere{} should have any suffix other than \verb|.sml|.
To run the tool, type:
\begin{alltt}
    mythryld --runtime-heap-image-to-run=nowhere inputfile
\end{alltt}

\section{Bugs and Missing Features}
   Currently, these things are missing:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Language extensions, such as array and vector patterns, are currently not supported. 
  \item Type checking of patterns is missing.
  \item The error messages may be less than clear.  Furthermore, 
        line reporting may be out-of-sync.
\end{enumerate}
