# squash-jumps-and-write-code-to-code-segment-buffer.api
#
# API for the packages which select shortest possible representation
# for each branch and jump instruction and then generate the final
# absolute machine-code bytevector for the file being compiled.
#
# (Don't ask *me* why those are both done by the same package!)

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/compiler/back/low/lib/lowhalf.lib
