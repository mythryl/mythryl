"LOWHALF" is short for "low level intermediate
code representations and transformations", where
by "low-level" we mainly mean "machine-dependent".

In practice, a fair amount of the optimization
work we do here does in fact apply to all
supported architectures.

Our "lowhalf" module is a derivative of MLRISC:
