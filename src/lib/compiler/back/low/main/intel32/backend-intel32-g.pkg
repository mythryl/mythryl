# execode (absolute binary machine code) generation for intel32 architecture.
#
# The Linux ( / *bsd /...) and Win32 backends reference us in
#
#     src/lib/compiler/toplevel/compiler/mythryl-compiler-for-intel32-posix.pkg
#     src/lib/compiler/toplevel/compiler/mythryl-compiler-for-intel32-win32.pkg
#
# respectively.
#
# Our generic parameters serve to encapsulate the
# differences between the Linux / *bsd / ... an the Win32
# fn-call conventions and related platform-specific issues.
#
# "backend_tophalf_g" does the "high-level" (machine-independent)
# code optimizations and transformations.
#
# "backend_lowhalf_intel32_g" does the "low-level" (machine-dependent)
# code optimizations and transformations.
