## make-mythryl-compiler-etc.pkg

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/core/internal/interactive-system.lib


# Run the make_mythryl_compiler_etc_g generic which builds the compiler and related stuff.
#
# It is important that this generic is done executing by the time
# the mythryld main package code (src/lib/core/internal/make-mythryld-executable.pkg)
# runs:  Otherwise, we would never be able to get rid of makelib/make_compiler
# from an interactive heap image.

###                    When we had completed the details,
###                    we rewrote everything so that no
###                    one could tell how we came upon
###                    our ideas or why. This is the
###                    standard in mathematics."
