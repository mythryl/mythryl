# This file implements the bootstrap communication bridge
# between Mythryl- and C-level code.  In particular, it
# implements access to the
#
#     get_mythryl_callable_c_function
# in
#     src/c/lib/mythryl-callable-c-libraries.c
#
# which provides Mythryl-level access to all the C libraries listed in
#
#     src/c/lib/mythryl-callable-c-libraries-list.h
#
# Our code here in   runtime.pkg   is essentially a dummy -- the
# actual package implementation is constructed in
#
#     src/c/main/construct-runtime-package.c
#
# leaning heavily on code from the platform-specific files
#
#     src/c/machine-dependent/prim.intel32.asm
#     src/c/machine-dependent/prim.sparc32.asm
#     src/c/machine-dependent/prim.pwrpc32.asm
#     src/c/machine-dependent/prim.intel32.masm
#
# Mythryl source code is compiled against these declarations.
#
# There is a kludge in mythryl-runtime-intel32 so that at linktime references
# to the below heap values are transparently redirected to the
# actual C implementations.
#
# Parts of this kludge are in
#    src/c/main/load-compiledfiles.c: load_compiled_files__may_heapclean
#    src/app/makelib/mythryl-compiler-compiler/find-set-of-compiledfiles-for-executable.pkg
# -- search for "RUNTIME_PACKAGE_PICKLEHASH".
#
# The required special handling for runtime.pkg
# is specified by the "runtime-system-placeholder" line in the file
#     src/lib/core/init/init.cmi
# and then implemented in
#     src/app/makelib/mythryl-compiler-compiler/process-mythryl-primordial-library.pkg
#
# The C global variable
#
#     runtime_package__global
#
# holds the actual 'runtime' package definition constructed by
# 
#      construct_runtime_package__global ()	from   src/c/main/construct-runtime-package.c
#
# and substituded by
#
#     load_compiled_files__may_heapclean ()	from   src/c/main/load-compiledfiles.c 
#
# for the placeholder
#
#     runtime.pkg.compiled
#
# file.
#
# This is the central sleight-of-hand which makes everything work.
