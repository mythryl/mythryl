## proto-pervasive.pkg
#
# 'pervasive' defines the types etc which are
# universally available in Mythryl code -- see
#
#     src/lib/core/init/pervasive.pkg
#
# Here we define a bootstrap version of pervasive.
# (This is needed to break a-needs-b-but-b-needs-a
# type dependency cycles during startup.)

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/core/init/init.cmi
