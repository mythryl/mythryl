x-kit-2.0a
------------------------

GRAPHICS UTILITIES
  - modifications to xauth.pkg to unpack IP addresses from Xauth file 
     to strings for comparison; if "localhost" is specified as the
     host to connect to, search Xauth file by the actual hostname.
    [Feb 2005]

LIBRARY CHANGES
  - modified createSimpleTopWin to return channel on which X window
     managers may notify the window of deletion events:
       val createSimpleTopWin : Display.screen -> {
          geom : Geometry.win_geom,
          border : ColorServer.color,
          backgrnd : ColorServer.color
       } -> (window * WindowEnv.in_env * WindowEnv.client_msg MULTIPROG.chan)
    [Jan 2005]

  - added ICCC.xrdbOfScr, whereby an application may retrieve the strings
     stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property of the root window by xrdb.
       val xrdbOfScr    : EXB.screen -> string list
    [May 2004]

WIDGET CHANGES
  - routers in composite widgets now have buffered output channels;
     this is an attempt at deadlock avoidance. (More to come on this...)
    [Nov 2004]

  - added the following to Widget Root, which widgets can use to obtain
     resource specifications from xrdb, merge resource styles, and parse
     command line arguments more easily.

    Insert all of the resource specifications of the first style into
    the second style, effectively giving priority to the specifications
    of the first style.
     val mergeStyles : style * style -> style

    Create a style from the stings stored by xrdb in the RESOURCE_MANAGER
    property of the root window.
     val styleFromXRDB : root -> style

    The following provide support for command line argument "parsing":
     datatype optName 
        = OPT_NAMED of string   (* custom options: retrieve by name *)
        | OPT_RESSPEC of string (* resource options: convert to a style *)
     type argName = string (* option spec string in argv *)
     datatype optKind
        = OPT_NOARG of string (* as XrmoptionNoArg. optname will assume this 
                                value if argName is specified in argv *)
        | OPT_ISARG     (* as XrmoptionIsArg:     value is option string itself *)
        | OPT_STICKYARG (* as XrmoptionStickyArg: value is chars immediately
                           following option *)
        | OPT_SEPARG    (* as XrmoptionSepArg:    value is next argument in argv *)
        | OPT_RESARG    (* as XrmoptionResArg:    resource and value in next 
                           argument in argv *)
        | OPT_SKIPARG   (* as XrmSkipArg:         ignore this option and next 
                           argument in argv *)
        | OPT_SKIPLINE  (* as XrmSkipLine:        ignore this option and the 
                           rest of argv *)
     datatype optVal
        = OPT_ATTRVAL of (string * AV.attr_type)
        | OPT_STRING of string
     (* option specification table: name for searching, name in argv, 
        kind of option, and type of option *)
     type optSpec = (optName * argName * optKind * AV.attr_type) list
     type optDb
     type attr_value
     val parseCommand : optSpec -> string list -> optDb * string list
     val findNamedOpt : optDb -> optName -> root -> attr_value list
     val findNamedOptStrings : optDb -> optName -> string list
     val styleFromOptDb : root * optDb -> style

    [May 2004]

  - Added function setWMProtocols (window.pkg,x-kit-win.sml,xprops.pkg)

(2 November 1992)

  - split lib/window/window.pkg into window.api and window.pkg.

  - added background and border color fields to representation of windows.
    This is necessary to avoid premature deallocation of those color
    cells, once color finalization is implemented.

  - changed "Drawing.autoflush" to "Drawing.feedback"

  - Implemented a new, more abstract, color model.  Each screen has a color
    server that maps abstract color specifications (color_spec_t) to
    an abstract representation of colors (color_t).  The pixel type is no
    longer visible to the user level.

  - Added number of buffered messages count to mapped state of draw-master.

  - Added Font.charPositions to return per character positions of a string.

    datatypes lie in allowed ranges for the X protocol.  Added related
    exceptions BadRGB, BadDrawParameter, BadPenParameter, BadWindowGeometry
    and BadPixmapParameter.

  - NoColorCell exception added to X-KitBase (and Color), for attempts to
    allocate a new color cell when the color map is full.

  - Immutable tiles are now used where pixmaps used to be allowed.

GRAPHICS UTILITIES
  - Added routine for generating general ellipses.
    [10/05/92]

  - Fixed bug in spline code concerning when line is flat enough.
    [10/03/92]

    (lib/graph_util).
    [10/03/92]

  - Added routines for drawing/filling rounded rectangles.
    [09/03/92]

    when it receives a KillReq from its child (shell.pkg).
    [02/12/93]

  - The bounds function for str_edit is more correctly and efficiently
    handled. It is also no flexible in the x dimension (str-edit.pkg).
    [02/12/93]

  - Unnecessary case "013" removed from echo server (vtty.pkg)
    [02/12/93]

  - Field name "rad" changed to "radius" in mkToggleCircle (toggle.pkg)
    [02/12/93]

  - Many widget exceptions replaced by LibBase.BadArg (slider.pkg,
    scrollbar.pkg, divider.pkg, button-view.pkg, str-edit.pkg,
    widget.pkg, frame.pkg, viewport.api, viewport.pkg
    [02/12/93]

  - Exceptions BadWidth and MultipleChoices exposed in text-list.pkg
    [02/11/93]

  - Unused exception BadWidth removed from color-rect.pkg
    [02/11/93]

    whereFn_t (simple-menu.pkg)

  - Added code to prevent possible deadlock dealing with child CO
    events (widget.pkg, shell.pkg, box.pkg, shape.pkg, field-edit.pkg)

(11 November 1992)

  - Fixed bugs in vtty.pkg, toggle-ctrl.pkg

(10 November 1992)

  - Added WidgetSet structure (widget-set.pkg); new version of
    TextList using WidgetSet

(5 November 1992)
  - The widget library assumes util-lib library loaded

  - Added mkTransientShell and removed setWMHints from Shell

  - Added wstate_t type to Widget; replaces button_state_t

  - Added sameRoot function to Widget

  - Made widgets abstract, with equality function. 

  - Removed window attributes for widgets. The wrapCreate function 
    was changed accordingly. Also, removed setBackground function 
    from Widget; use new background widget instead

  - Added several utility functions to Widget: okaySize, compatibleDim, 
    compatibleSize

  - Added ignoreMouse, ignoreKey functions for widgets

  - Toggles now take an initial state; in addition, a toggle now 
    fires its action routine if its state is changed under program control

  - Sliders now take an initial state; in addition, there are now functions for
    setting the state, plus querying the state and scale

  - The function mkSBLayout has been moved to its own structure ScrollLayout

  - TextList replaces the ListWidget structure. The user can now 
    specify an initial state for the items.

  - mkColorRect has been added to implement simple colored rectangular regions.

  - Where possible, composite widgets no longer need a root 
    argument (structures Frame, ScrollPort, Shape)

  - The Box structure now produces a box_layout_t, rather than a widget_t.
    (There is the usual widgetOf function.) In addition, one can now
    insert, delete, map, and unmap "boxes" in the top level of the box
    hierarchy

  - A Pile structure has been added. This implements a pile_t type, which
    maintains a collection of widgets, only one of which is visible at
    a time. Widgets can be inserted and deleted from piles.

(2 November 1992)

  - modified str-edit.pkg to allow character values in the range
    [0xa0-0xff].

    supports RGB and pixel.  [NOTE: this has been moved to the library
    level]

  - New widgets : Divider, MenuButton, ViewPort, ScrollPort

  - Label views, text button views and list items 
    reimplemented to use common text glyph.

    and mkFlex added.

  - Character insertion and deletion added to TextWidget

  - The Widget module now provides filter functions for the input streams,
    and a function to alter the background of a widget.

  - Toggle and button protocol has changed. Command and toggle buttons
    register a change on button up, not on button down. If button up
    occurs off the widget, no change is registered. Event streams for
    general buttons now terminate with either button up or exit, the latter
    indicating the mouse has left the widget. Buttons and toggles also now
    provide active/inactive state.


x-kit-0.3 (released 12/03/91)
-----------------------------

GLOBAL CHANGES:
  - x-kit is now based on MULTIPROG-0.9.4; this very required minor changes to
    x-kit (now using 0.9.6).

  - ported to SML/NJ 0.71.  Most changes were a result of the Array structure
    not being open by default, and by Array.sub no longer being an infix operator.
    Changed the representation of pen_t values to use immutable vectors.

LIBRARY CHANGES
  - fixed typechecking problem in protocol/xdisplay.pkg that was exposed
    by SML/NJ 0.70.

  - replaced draw_dst_t datatype with abstract drawable_t type.  This is
    part of the support for rubber-banding.

  - fixed xio.pkg bug caused by a faulty understanding of the sequencing
    semantics of the protocol.

  - fixed bugs in gc-server.pkg and draw-master.pkg reported by Huimin Lin
    (huimin@@cogs.susx.ac.uk).

  - fixed bug in HashUtil.mapList

  - changed remove function for hash tables to return the removed item.  This
    affected the hash tables defined in util/{hash-util.pkg,hash-xid.pkg},
    window/hash-window.pkg and user/x-kit-base.sml.

  - added window-tree locking mechanism to the window registry.

  - modified asynchronous blt operations to use a promise-style implementation.

  - added updatePen operation for functional updates of pens.

  - added createOverlay to support rubber-banding.

  - new Spline module providing functions to compute Bezier cubic sections,
    and open and closed B-splines.

  - added copyBlt and copyBltEvt.

  - fixed bug in decoding font info in xreply.pkg (wrong offset)

WIDGET CHANGES
  - fixed possible deadlock arising from parent not always servicing a child's
    CO event. This affected box.pkg and field-edit.pkg.

  - added new text list widget. The widget provides a vertical or horizontal
    display of text items, and events associated with the user choosing items.

  - the ButtonView structure now provides a new view mkTextBtn, which
    generalizes mkLabelBtn (rectangular buttons with string labels) by
    allowing the programmer to specify the border width and text alignment
    within the button.

  - fixed bug in Frame widget that was causing deadlock.

  - the SimpleMenu module has seen various bug fixes and style
    changes, as well as the addition of a low-level menu routine
    for providing pop-up menus within widgets.

  - there is now a working vtty widget (thanks to Thomas Yan for finishing
    our code)

  - the Canvas widget now provides a drawable, so that the library drawing
    routines can be used.


x-kit-0.2 (released 4/27/91)
-----------------------------

LIBRARY CHANGES
  - added absolute screen coordinates to mouse event messages

  - added tileBlt operation to Drawing

  - fixed GraphicsExpose/NoExpose problem.  Drawing.bitablet and Drawing.tileBlt
    will raise the exception Exposures, if part of the source is unavailable.
    Also, the PV_Exposures field for pens has been eliminated.

  - destroyWindow is now handled by the draw-master, which avoids a race
    with any pending drawing requests on the window.  This was a problem
    with popup windows.

  - added Geometry.inside; test if a rectangle is inside another

  - fixed bug in encodePolyRects, etc.

  - changed DrawMaster to group adjacent drawing requests that use the same pen.

  - fixed the shutdown deadlock that was causing the "x-kit-shutdown timeout"
    message.

WIDGET CHANGES
  - fixed deadlock in widgets/router.pkg

  - added tileBlt operation to Canvas widget

  - the menu widget is fixed

  - there is now a text widget

  - there is a text-field edit widget

  - the bounds_t type has been redefined; see the manual for details.

  - the box/glue layouts have been re-implemented.  Also, the layout semantics
    have changed; see the manual for details.

  - the type of Widget.wrapCreate has changed; point_t and size_t arguments were
    bundled into a rect_t argument.

  - additional button views have been added.

  - the shell widget now provides application access to window manager
    hints. In addition, the shell automatically registers size hints
    with the window manager.

EXAMPLES
  - the examples have been updated to use some of the new library features

  - a simple example of the menu widget has been added

  - a calculator has been implemented using the widget set.


x-kit-0.1 (released 3/19/91)
-----------------------------
  This was the first release
