## box2.pkg
#
# The standard x-kit box (rectangle) representation is defined in
#
#     src/lib/std/2d/geometry2d.api
#
# in terms of position + size in the form of int row/col/high/wide fields.
#
# Here we define a sometimes-useful alternate representation in
# terms of two corners specified as int x1/y1/x2/y2 fields.
#
# Note that the lower right point is not actually part of the rectangle.
# Explicitly,
#       BOX { x, y, wid, ht } corresponds to
# box2::BOX { x1=x, y1=y, x2=x+wid, y2=y+ht }. For certain computations (e.g.,
# constructing regions), this representation is more useful.

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/x-kit/draw/xkit-draw.sublib
