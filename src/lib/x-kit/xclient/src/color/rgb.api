## rgb.api
#
# RGB color values as opaque triples
#
#     (red: Float, green: Float, blue: Float)
#
# This is our preferred color representation;
# all other color representations implement
# to_rgb() and from_rgb() conversion functions.

# Compiled by:
#     src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xclient-internals.sublib

# This api is implemented in:
#
#     src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/color/rgb.pkg

api Rgb {

    # RGB colors 
    #
    # We represent an RGB color value by a
    # record of 64-bit floats holding
    # red, green, blue in that order.
    # (The compiler will optimize this to
    # a very efficient packed representation.)
    # 
    Rgb = { red:	Float,
	    green:	Float,
	    blue:	Float

    #
    black:   Rgb;
    gray:    Rgb;
    white:   Rgb;
    red:     Rgb;
    green:   Rgb;
    blue:    Rgb;
    cyan:    Rgb;
    magenta: Rgb;
    yellow:  Rgb;

    # We primarily think of color components as
    # ranging from 0.0 -> 1.0 inclusive:
    #
    rgb_from_floats:  (Float, Float, Float)  ->  Rgb;
    rgb_to_floats:    Rgb  ->  (Float, Float, Float);

    # The X protocol level likes to think
    # of color components as ranging from
    # 0 -> 65355 inclusive, so we support
    # that for implementation of X protocol
    # packet encoding and decoding.  This format
    # is not otherwise particularly recommended:
    #
    rgb_from_unts:    (Unt, Unt, Unt)  ->  Rgb;
    rgb_to_unts:      Rgb  ->  (Unt, Unt, Unt);

	#
	# Note that this 'same' function does
	# 64-bit float comparisons, and consequently
	# is very sensitive to rounding errors: Things
	# you expect to compare equal may fail to do so.
	#
	# If that is an issue in your application, you
	# may wish to convert to Rgb8 form (thus discarding
	# all but the most significant 8 bits of each color
	# component) and then use rgb8::same().

    rgb_complement:	Rgb -> Rgb;			# Set each component c to (1.0-c).

    rgb_mix:		(Float, Rgb, Rgb) -> Rgb;	# Linear interpolation in RGB space. 0.0 yields first color, 1.0 yields second color.

    rgb_normalize:	Rgb -> Rgb;			# Ensure all color components are in 0.0 -> 1.0 inclusive.

    rgb_from_name:	String -> Rgb;			# Raises exception lib_base::NOT_FOUND if given string is not in table.
	#
	# Return a color from x11_color_name::x11_colors table.

    rgb_to_grayscale:	Rgb -> Float;			# Using Rec 601 coefficients -- see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luma_(video)

    rgb_is_light:	Rgb -> Bool;			# TRUE iff   (rgb_to_grayscale c) > 0.5.
