#     "The canvas widget provides a drawing surface that
#      can also be used as a basis for building new widgets."
#        -- p24, Gansner+Reppy's 1993 eXene widget manual,

# Use 'drawable_of' to get the actual X "drawable"
# associated with the canvas.  For the set of types and
# functions available for drawing on a drawable see:
#
#     src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xdraw.api
#
# Note that the X-server side canvas does not actually
# exist until the canvas is realized;  attempting
# to draw on it prior to that will block the thread.
