## textmill.pkg							# emacs calls these 'buffers' but 'mill' is shorter and more parellel to 'pane'.
#								# Also, I want to eventually generalize this to various other foopane <-> foomill pairs, and generalize millboss to not know or care about the differences between them.
# A textmill contains (typically) the contents
# of one file open for editing.  It is not a
# GUI widget;  display of the textmill contents
# is handled by
#
#     src/lib/x-kit/widget/edit/textpane.pkg
#
# In "Model/View/Controller" terms, textmill.pkg
# is the Model and textpane.pkg is the View+Controller.
