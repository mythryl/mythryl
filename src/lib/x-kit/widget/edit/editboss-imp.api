## editboss-imp.api
#
# This imp is responsible for central coordination of our
# emacs-flavored text-editing facility. In particular it
# serves as a registry tracking all currently operational
# instances of
#
#     textpane.pkg
#     screenline.pkg
#     textmill.pkg
#
# editboss-imp is a delegate of guiboss-imp, offloading
# all centralized text-editor tasks from guiboss-imp,
# which is the ultimate central coordinator of all GUI
# stuff including editing.  guiboss-imp starts us up
# as part of its startup sequence, and we run until
# guiboss-imp shuts down.
