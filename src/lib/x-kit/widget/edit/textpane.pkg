# textpane.pkg
#
# This package manages one view onto a textbuffer,
# consisting of a number of 
#
#     src/lib/x-kit/widget/edit/lineeditor.pkg
#
# instances displaying (part of) the contents of
# the textbuffer, plus one
#
#     src/lib/x-kit/widget/edit/statusline.pkg
#
# instance displaying the dirtyflag, filename etc
# associated with the textbuffer.
#
# In "Model/View/Controller" terms, textbuffer-imp.pkg
# is the Model and textpane.pkg is the View+Controller.
#
# (textpane.pkg also draws the visible frame around
# the textpane contents, but that is largely incidental
# to its main function.)
#
# Per emacs tradition, we allow multiple textpanes
# to be simultaneously open onto a single textbuffer;
# this heavily influences the design and implementation.
#
