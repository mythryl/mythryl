Files in this directory: 

	hol-support.pkg      : package used to build tactic tree interface on top of HOL
        make-interactive.pkg : builds interactive version of tactic tree interface 

It is assumed that all of the tactic_tree/src/ files have already been read into x-kit. 
This is meant to be built on top of version SML New Jersey version of HOL, 
(for information contact Elsa Gunter, elsa@research.att.com) that has been 
been built on top of x-kit, or had x-kit built on top of it. 

The interactive version of tactic trees for HOL provides the following functions: 
 
create : term * string * string list -> ttree_state

	create(f,s,l) opens up a window with term f as the top-level
        goal (no assumptions) on display s with tactic menu extension l. 
        l is a list of strings -- each should parse to an ML value of type 
	tactic.  s is a string that tells the X server which screen you want 
        the window to pop up on. Check your unix envrironment variable DISPLAY. 

view : ttree_state * string * string list -> ttree_state

	view(p,s,l) opens up a window for tactic-tree state p 
        on display s with tactic menu extension l. 
	
extract_event : ttree_state -> thm 

	extract_event p will return the HOL thm proved by the tactic-tree in state
	p. Assumes that all subgoals have been proven. 

extract_tactic : ttree_state -> string 

	extract_tactic p will return a string representing the HOL tactic that if 
	applied to the top-level goal will produce the fringe (unproven subgoals) 
        of the tactic tree. 

extract_text : ttree_state -> string -> unit

	extract_text p s writes the tree represented by p to the file s.
