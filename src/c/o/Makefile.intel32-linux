# These days in the opensource world the clear preference is to

# HISTORY
#
# 2006-11-29CrT: Added "-D_REENTRANT" per src/c-glue/README
#
# 2011-10-26CrT: According to   http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-help/2007-01/msg00138.html
#
#                    "In typical cases, the gcc -pthread option does a #define of _REENTRANT
#                     and causes gcc to link against -lpthread.  That's it."
#
#                so having both -pthread and also -D_REENTRANT/-lpthread is probably redundant -- and having
#                just the former sounds best (and seems to be what current tutorials show).
