###                 "I had forgotten how incredibly and unforgivably sloppy
###                  the average mathematician is, how inconsistent about his syntax
###                  and how vague about the scopes of definitions and quantifications.
###                  I love mathematics, but it's the mathematicians I cannot stand,
###                  for since ALGOL 60 there is no longer an excuse."
