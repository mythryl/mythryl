# Compiled by:
#     src/app/make7/Make7.make6



# This file specifies the core state
# maintained during a make7 session:
#
# anchor_dictionary Tracks the 'anchors' such as '$ROOT'
#                   which appear in .make6 files to re/locate
#                   files and directories.  The anchor_dictionary
#                   is a lot like the unix string "environment"
#                   holding the TMPDIR and PATH &tc settings.
#
# filename_policy   Records the naming conventions for various
#                   compiler-generated files like foo.pkg.o7 &tc.
#
# host_property     Provides read/write access to a few critical
#                   machine-dependent values such as architecture
#                   name ("PPC"/"SPARC"/"X86") and word length in bits.
#
# platform          Names architecture and operating system:  "x86-linux" or such.
#
# keep_going        A boolean flag indicating whether make7 should attempt
#                   to continue compiling after encountering a file with
#                   compile errors.
#
# server_mode       Used to remember whether we're the primary compile
#                   process or a secondary compile-server process, possibly
#                   on another machine entirely.
#
# library_source_index
#                   Maps filenames to sourcefile line-and-column info.
#
# plaint_sink is where we send compile error messages.
#                  Think 'stderr'.
#
# youngest	    Most recent (known) edit of any sourcefile in the library.
#                   (I.e., if the freezefile for a library is older than this,
#		    or the "executable" for an application built from that library,
#		    then it is out of date and may need to be rebuilt.)
