# OVERVIEW
#
#     In this file we define a datastructure
#     containing all the makefile information
#     for an application, in the form of a graph
#     with one node per .make6 file (==library)
#     and for each such node:
#
#        o A map 'o7_views_by_name' giving access
#          to all the .o7 files "owned" by the
#          library.  (If the library is "frozen",
#          these .o7 files will be physically
#          packed within the library freezefile.
#          If the library is not frozen, the .o7
#          files are read directly off disk as
#          needed, one by one.)
#
#        o A list 'sublibraries' of all .make6
#          files referenced by this library's
#          .make6file.
#
#        o Various other useful bookkeeping info.
#
#
#     make7 also maintains more detailed dependency
#     graphs at the level of individual source files.
#     These are implemented in 
#
#         ./intra-library-dependency-graph.pkg
#
#     See the top-of-file comments in that file for
#     a general dependency-graph orientation.
#
#
#
# MOTIVATION
#
#     To a first approximation, an application
#     is specified by some root .make6 makefile
#     plus all the make6files it mentions, all
#     the make6files -they- mention &tc.
#
#     We may represent this as a graph with one
#     node per .make6 makefile, and one edge
#     for mention of one .make6 makefile by another.
#
#     At the highest level, we may then think of
#     compiling an application in terms of doing
#     a post-order treewalk of this graph, compiling
#     all the .o7 files specified by a given makefile
#     after building all of its sub-makefiles.
#
#     In practice, we take a linker's eye view of
#     the world and think in terms of a graph of
#     libraries rather one of makefiles.
#
#     Since each makefile specifies one library,
#     this isn't really much different.
# 
#
#
#
# DATA STRUCTURES
#
#
#     LIBRARY
#
#         Our LIBRARY record represents in essence
#         a complete .make6 makefile, or in linker's-eye
#         terms, everything compiled by a given .make6
#         makefile.
#
#             'library_path' field -- names the makefile involved.
#         
#
#
#     VIRTUAL / REAL
#
#         A VIRTUAL LIBRARY is one which is never
#         intended to exist as a single freezefile.
#         The compiled code for these libraries
#         is always loaded directly from individual
#         .o7 diskfiles, or else from other freezefiles.
#
#         VIRTUAL libraries may be used to provide
#	  an internal hierarchical structure to a
#	  REAL library, by defining a tree of
#         VIRTUAL sub-libraries referenced by the
#         main REAL library:  When the parent REAL
#         library gets frozen, the contents of all
#         its VIRTUAL descendents are included in
#         the generated freezefile, making it look
#         like a single library for all external
#         purposes.
#
#         Any LIBRARY which isn't VIRTUAL is REAL.
#
#
#
#     FROZEN / THAWED
#
#         A REAL library whose freezefile has not yet
#         been constructed is marked THAWED.
#
#         Once the actual freezefile on disk has been
#         built, the REAL library is marked FROZEN.
#
#         Freezing a REAL library is in general not
#         done automatically, but rather only in response
#         to an explicit user make7::freeze command.
#
#         In the meantime, a THAWED REAL library works 
#         very much like a VIRTUAL library -- the relevant
#         .o7 files are read directly off disk as needed.  
#
#         Thus, it is not necessary to build an actual
#         freezefile for a REAL library in order to
#         link against it.  
#
#         During development, leaving a REAL library
#         as THAWED may yield quicker turnaround times.
#
#         Once the code is stable, the library may be FROZEN
#         in order to reduce start-up and link times.
#
#         The FROZEN "clear_pickle_cache" function may be invoked
#         to remove the associated objectfile "pickles" from
#         memory, on machines where RAM is tight.			"flush the pickle cache" would seem to be more perspicuous terminology
#
#         This is a strictly a space/time system-tuning
#         tradeoff -- deleted pickles will be automatically
#         re-read as needed.
#
#         Pickle-cache clearing is off by default.
#
#
#
#     'Oh7_View' type
#
#         The exports of an .o7 file are represented by an "Oh7_View".
#         An Oh7_View is essentially just as set of Far_O7 nodes, but
#         it also has an exports_dictionary which contains information
#         about the actual definitions (contents) of exported packages/generics.
#         This information is necessary to handle the Lib7 "run" construct.
#
#
#
#     'required_privileges' field
#
#         "Privileges" are a nascent capability system to
#         keep some code modules (or users) from doing
#         some sorts of things, such as writing to disk
#         in a networked server process, say.
#
#         As yet, this mechanism doesn't actually do
#         anything but print out compiletime messages.
#
#         The "required_privileges" field includes everything:
#
#             1. privileges required by sublibraries
#             2. newly required privileges
#             3. privileges that would be wrapped once the group library is built

        );

    # The library specified by a .make6 file can be
    # "frozen" (via make7::freeze())
    # to produce a concrete .frozen freezefile physically
    # containing images of all the .o7 files compiled
    # from all the .pkg and .api sourcefiles going into
    # the library.
    #
    # This is the production situation, and corresponds
    # to the usual unix situation with a libfoo.a or
    # libfoo.so library file.
    #
    # However, the Mythryl library specified by a
    # .make6 file can also be used (linked against)
    # in the "thawed" state, when no .frozen file exists.
    #
    # In this situation, the needed .o7 files are
    # read directly off disk as needed.  This arrangement
    # can be useful during active development, since the
    # rebuild-the-.frozen-file step can be omitted from the
    # edit-compile-run development cycle, saving some time.
    #
    # Also, in a thawed library, all necessary re/compiles
    # can be done by a simple make7 call, because make7
    # checks that every individual .o7 file on disk is
    # up-to-date relative to its sourcefile before using
    # it (and automatically does a recompile if it is not).  
    #
    # In a frozen library, on the other hand, all .o7 files
    # found in the freezefile are used as-is without further
    # checking; the .make6 file and the .api and .pkg source
    # files need not even exist.  This yields stable libraries
    # and fast start-up times, both suitable for production
    # use of a developmentally mature library.
