# Here we define a special app which 'make's
# the compiler itself, a task which presents
# special-case problems such as bootstrapping
# a valid initial runtime state from nothing.
#
# (To 'make' any Mythryl program other than the
# compiler, we use the
#     src/app/make7/main/make7-g.pkg
# app.)
#
#
#
# In this file, we do essentially the following:
#
#
#  1)   Parse the "primordial" library specfile
#
#           src/lib/core/init/init.cmi
#
#       by calling
#
#           primordial_make7file::process
#       
#       init.cmi has a special syntax and defines
#       various life-critical things like TRUE that
#       must be in place before vanilla .make6file
#       processing can take place.
#
#
#  2)   Compile the primordial library if a usable
#       freezefile is not already available for it.
#
#
#  3)   Load the primordial library into memory.
#
#
#  4)   Call
#
#           make7file::build_interlibrary_dependency_graph_from_make7file_tree
#
#       on the compiler's root .make6file
#
#           src/etc/root.make6
#
#       (which then recursively runs all
#       the other .make6 files in the compiler)
#       to ensure that all the libraries
#       which are to be linked into the
#
#           bin/mythryld
#
#       "executable" heap image are up to date.
#
#       In the usual   lone_primary   case we pass this
#       function a FREEZE_ALL arg which forces it to make
#       .frozen freezefiles for all (real) libraries lacking them,
#       which in turn forces all .pkg and .api sourcefiles to
#       compile if they have not already done so.
#
#       In the (common) limiting case this requires
#       recompiling all the relevant .api and .pkg
#       sourcefiles and packing the resulting .o7
#       files into .frozen library freezefiles.
#
#
#  5)   Write out two diskfiles named
#
#           OH7_FILES_TO_LOAD
#           LIBRARY_CONTENTS
#
#       containing all the information needed to
#       link the compiler libraries together to
#       form the   bin/mythryld   "executable".
#
#       Later, the
#
#           sh/make-compiler-executable
#
#       script will hand the above two files to
#
#           bin/runtime7
#
#       to generate the actual   bin/mythryld
#       "executable" heap image, but that is
#       outside of our purview;  we are just
#       a subroutine invoked by the
#
#           sh/make-compiler-libraries
#
#       script.
#
#
#  (make-compiler-g.pkg also contains a fair amount
#  of non-working code intended to support parallel
#  and distributed compiles, which probably should be
#  ripped out and rewritten from scratch.   XXX BUGGO FIXME.) 
#
#
#     [ At some point we should tweak the code to hide the
#       special-case kludging around here from the user,
#       so that at the command-line level, compiling and
#       linking the compiler looks just like compiling
#       and linking any other program. XXX BUGGO FIXME. ]
#
#
#
# Api:
#
#     We get :-sealed as  Make_Compiler			# Make_Compiler	is from   src/lib/core/internal/make-compiler.api
#
#
#
# Generic invocation context:
#
#     The generic we define is invoked in
#
#         src/lib/core/make-compiler/x86-unix.pkg
#
#     to define compile_x86_unix_compiler -- the other platforms
#     define similar platform-specific backends.
#
#     One of these gets defined as make_compiler (the default
#     bootstrap compiler) via conditional inclusion in
#
#         src/lib/core/make-compiler/current.make6
#
#     which gets invoked by src/etc/make-compiler
#     which gets invoked by a toplevel 'make self'
#
#
#
# Generic arguments:
#
#     "compiler_client_interface" is defined by
#
#             package compiler_client_interface = x86_unix_compiler_client_interface;
#         in
#             src/lib/compiler/toplevel/backend/x86-unix-compiler-client-interface.pkg
#
#         which gets conditionally included by
#
#             src/lib/core/compiler/current.make6
#
#         (The above is for "x86-linux" platforms:
#         The pattern is similar on other platforms.)
#
#     "read_eval_print_from_stream" is backend::interact::read_eval_print_from_stream
#         which interact_g defines in
#
#             src/lib/compiler/toplevel/interact/interact-g.pkg
#
#         as a simple wrapper around the read_eval_print_from_stream
#         function defined by read_eval_print_loop_g in
#
#             src/lib/compiler/toplevel/interact/read-eval-print-loop-g.pkg
#     
#
# Runtime invocation context:
#
#     One path is via
#         src/lib/core/internal/main.pkg                    "boot_dictionary:set_up root_directory"
#         src/lib/core/internal/boot-dictionary-g.pkg     "cmbmake ()"
#         src/lib/core/internal/boot-dictionary.pkg         make_compiler::make' (...)
#
#     The most usual invocation is via
#	      "make compiler"	
#             Makefile ->
#                 sh/make-compiler-libraries
#         which first constructs the bootstrap compiler by running mythryld on
#             src/lib/core/make-compiler/current.make6
#         and then invokes it via a script-embedded
#             make_compiler::make ()
#
#     Either way, we quickly wind up at make'()
#     at the bottom of this file, and away we go.
