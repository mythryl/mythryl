\section{Scripts}

This section gives a detailed description for each script, its
function, and its options.  All scripts described here are located in
the {\tt src/system} directory.\footnote{If the current directory {\tt
.} is not on the shell's search path, then each script must be invoked
using an explicit {\tt ./}-prefix.


\subsection{The {\tt installml} script}

The {\tt installml} script moves a heap image {\tt $v$.{\it arch}-{\it osname}}
to {\tt ../../heap/mythryld.{\it arch}-{\it osname}}.  Moreover, it
moves the libraries under {\tt $v$.lib} to {\tt ../../lib} and updates
{\tt ../../lib/pathconfig} accordingly.

The script takes one optional argument which specifies $v$.  If no
argument is given, $v$ defaults to {\tt sml}.

\subsection{The {\tt allcross} script}

Finally, the {\tt allcross} script is handy for building compiledfile- and
boot-files for all architectures.  The script currently takes no
arguments and compiles (and cross-compiles) for supported
combinations of {\it arch} and {\it os}: {\tt pwrpc32-unix}, {\tt sparc32-unix}, {\tt intel32-unix}, and {\tt
intel32-win32}.
