\section{Available libraries}

Compiler and interactive system consist of several hundred
individual compilation units.  Like modules of application programs,
these compilation units are also organized using makelib libraries.  

Some of the libraries that make up the compiler are actually the same ones
that application programmers are likely to use, others exist for
organizational purposes only.  There are ``plugin'' libraries---mainly
for the makelib ``tools'' subsystem---that will be automatically loaded on
demand, and libraries such as {\tt \$ROOT/src/lib/core/mythryl-compiler-compiler/mythryl-compiler-compiler-for-this-platform.lib} can be used to
obtain access to functionality that by default is not present.

\subsection{Libraries for general programming}

Libraries listed in the following table provide a broad palette of
general-purpose programming tools\footnote{Recall that anchored paths
of the form {\tt \$$/x[/\cdots]$} act as an abbreviation for {\tt
\$$x/x[/\cdots]$}.}:

\begin{small}

\subsection{Libraries for controlling compiler operation}

The following table lists those libraries that provide access to the
so-called {\em visible compiler} infrastructure and to the compilation
manager API.

\begin{small}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{p{2.3in}||p{2.5in}|c|c}
name & description & installed & loaded \\
\hline\hline

\subsection{Libraries for compiler hackers}

The following table lists libraries that provide access to the
{\em bootstrap compiler}.  The bootstrap compiler is a derivative of
the compilation manager.  In addition to being able to recompile
the compiler for the ``host'' system there are also cross-compilers that
can target all of our supported platforms.

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{small}

Libraries for the lowhalf backend have internal dependencies.  However,
when referring to a {\tt \$LIB7_LOWER/{\it lib}.lib} library, all
anchor names that correspond to these dependencies are still unbound.
Thus, a client would have to provide its own namings for
them.\footnote{The anchor names coincide with the {\it lib}{\tt .lib}
components of the above names.} There is an analogous set of library
names of the form {\tt \$ROOT/src/lib/core/lower/}{\it lib}{\tt .lib} which
provides the backend-specific namings for all the anchors.  In
practice this means that if one refers to, e.g., {\tt
\$ROOT/src/lib/core/lower/lowhalf.lib}, one will implicitly pick up {\tt
\$ROOT/src/lib/core/lower/Graphs.lib}, and the {\tt \$Graphs.lib} anchor within the
former will be resolved to the latter.  On the other hand, when
referring directly to the ``raw'' library {\tt
\$LIB7_LOWER/lowhalf.lib}, one still can (and must) provide one's own
naming for {\tt \$Graphs.lib}.
