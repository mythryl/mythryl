# Compiled by:

# Verifying the validity of an existing freezefile.
#
#   - This is used for "paranoia" mode during bootstrap compilation.
#     Normally, makelib accepts freezefiles and doesn't ask questions,
#     but during bootstrap compilation it takes the freezefile only
#     if it is verified to be valid.
