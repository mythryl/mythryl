## makelib-state.pkg -- general makelib state information.

# Compiled by:
#     src/app/makelib/makelib.sublib



# This file specifies the core state
# maintained during a makelib session:
#
# anchor_dictionary Tracks the 'anchors' such as '$ROOT'
#                   which appear in .lib files to re/locate
#                   files and directories.  The anchor_dictionary
#                   is a lot like the unix string "environment"
#                   holding the TMPDIR and PATH etc settings.
#		    Currently $ROOT is the only anchor used.
#
# filename_policy   Records the naming conventions for various
#                   compiler-generated files like foo.pkg.compiled etc.
#
# find_makelib_preprocessor_symbol
#                   Provides read/write access to the makelib preprocessor
#                   dictionary which holds the values tested by .lib file lines like
#                       #if defined(FOO)
#                   This dictionary is pre-loaded with a few machine-dependent values
#                   such as architecture name ("PWRPC32"/"SPARC32"/"INTEL32") and word length
#                   in bits -- see
#                       src/app/makelib/main/makelib-preprocessor-state-g.pkg
#                       src/app/makelib/main/makelib-preprocessor-dictionary.pkg
#
# platform          Names architecture and operating system:  "intel32-linux" or such.
#
# keep_going_after_compile_errors
#		    A boolean flag indicating whether makelib should attempt
#                   to continue compiling after encountering a file with
#                   compile errors.
#
# we_are_a_subprocess
#                   Used to remember whether we're the primary compile
#                   process or a secondary compile-server subprocess.
#
# library_source_index
#                   Maps filenames to sourcefile line-and-column info.
#
# plaint_sink is where we send compile error messages.
#                  Think 'stderr'.
#
# youngest	    Most recent known edit of any sourcefile in the library --
#                   we need to recompile if the .lib.frozen or "executable"
#                   files are older than this,
