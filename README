README for Mythryl

Installing Mythryl
==================

Mythryl is currently developed on 32-bit x86 Debian Linux. ("stable".)
The distribution provided should build on most (all?) x86 Linux
platforms, and perhaps some x86 BSDs.  It is known not to install
on Mac OS X.  It definitely will NOT install on non-x86 platforms
as distributed.

(Since Mythryl is a self-compiling system, this source distribution
necessarily also includes a set of seed binary files for bootstrap
purposes, hence the comparatively large size of the tarball.)

You may unpack it on most platforms by doing

    tar -xjf mythryl.110.58*tar.bz2

Next, 'cd' into the directory thus created.

Sometime this year I'm going to put together decent Mythryl library
re/configuration support.  For now, however, all my favorite stuff
is just statically linked into the Mythryl runtime, so you'll just
have to install it all.

First off, make sure you have the standard C and Gtk
development libraries and header files installed.
On Debian or Ubuntu this will include

    libc6-dev
    libgtkglext1-dev
    libgtk2.0-0
    libgtk2.0-bin
    libgtk2.0-common
    libgtk2.0-dev

At present you will also need the OpenGL, GLFW and GLEW libs.
On Debian or Ubuntu this is like to mean

    glew-utils - The OpenGL Extension Wrangler - utilities
    libglew1.5-dev - The OpenGL Extension Wrangler - development environment
    libglew1.5 - The OpenGL Extension Wrangler - runtime environment
    libglewmx1.5-dev - The OpenGL Extension Wrangler - development environment
    libglewmx1.5 - The OpenGL Extension Wrangler - runtime environment

    libglfw-dev
    libglfw2

The core OpenGL libs to use will depend on various things;
the safe, standard, portable (but low-performance) option is:

    libglu1-mesa
    libgl1-mesa-glx

By default Mythryl compiles with the gcc -Werror switch
("treat warnings as errors").  This is normally good but
can be a problem if you are using a version of the compiler
more recent than that used by the developers, which generates
additional warnings.  If so, you may disable this by editing
CFLAGS in the relevant makefile(s), most likely

    src/c/o/Makefile.in

and doing

    make dist-clean
    make compiler

to rebuild.

If Mythryl segfaults it will generate an informative heapdump
for debugging purposes.  This will include disassembly of the
compiled Mythryl x86 code if libdisasm is present.  This
library is available from

    http://bastard.sourceforge.net/libdisasm.html

which on Debian (and Debian-derived Linux distros like Ubuntu) 
is available via the packages

    libdisasm0
    libdisasm-dev

Lack of these libraries will seldom if ever matter to the
typical Mythry user or Mythryl application programmer.


# To play with the (currently nonfunctional) Mythryl OpenCV
# library bindings, you'd also need the OpenCV development
# libraries and header files:
#    libcv1
#    libcv-dev
#    libcvaux1
#    libcvaux-dev
#    libhighgui1
#    libhighgui-dev
# NB:  The "make check" code exercising these is currently
# commented out in   src/lib/test/unit-tests.make7
# and                src/lib/test/all-unit-tests.pkg 

Do
    make compiler

As root do

    make install

This will install the following executables:

    /usr/bin/mythryl                    # The wrapper C program which makes script-style Mythryl shebang invocation work.
    /usr/bin/mythryl-runtime-intel32    # The C-coded runtime which actually executes the 'mythryld' heap image.
    /usr/bin/mythryld                   # The compiler proper, with all major libraries preloaded, as an "executable" heap image.
    /usr/bin/my                         # Symlink to the above, for brevity and interaction. 
    /usr/bin/mythryl-gtk-server         # Mythryl Gtk library support. This is a work in progress.

With that done, you should be able to execute
the provided

    try/hello

Mythryl script.  At that point I suggest
consulting the tutorial pages at

    http://mythryl.org

If you find Mythryl interesting, you may wish to
subscribe to the mailing list to get announcements
of new releases:

    http://mythryl.org/mailman/listinfo/mythryl

This is a low-traffic list.

One final hint:  Mythryl has an interactive mode invoked by doing 'my'
at the shell prompt.  This does not currently implement GNU readline
style history etc.  If you run 'my' under x/emacs shell-mode (as I do)
this lack will probably not bother you; if you don't, or if it does,
one popular solution is

   rlwrap

Alternatives available in Debian/Ubuntu/etc include:

    ledit - line editor for interactive programs 
    rlfe - A front-end using readline to "cook" input lines for other programs 
    rlwrap - readline feature command line wrapper 

Happy hacking! :)

Mythryl Development Cycle
=========================

For what it is worth, the compiler development cycle I use is:

    loop {

        edit madly              # In xemacs, of course! :)

        make compiler           # Build the compiler and core libraries.
        make rest               # Build the rest of the distribution -- x-kit &tc.

        sudo make install       # Install executables in /usr/bin

        make check              # Verify that nothing obvious is broken.
                                # These checks run the /usr/bin copies
                                # of the executables, so if you skip the
                                # above install, you're testing the wrong
                                # version.  (I actually do "make cheg" rather
                                # than "make check", which exercises some
                                # additional code, but "make check" should do
                                # nicely for most developers.)

        make tar                # Save a known-good copy of the codebase.
                                # (I actually do "make tart", which also
                                # rebuilds the emacs "tags" file.) 
    }

I usually run the above cycle roughly once an hour
during development.

If something breaks, I rarely debug.  Instead I go back
to the most recent known-good tarball and set forth
again from it, only more carefully this time.

Once a day or so, I make a remote backup of a known-good
tarball.

Once a month or so, I prune my collection of old tarballs
down to one per day.

When I wake up with my finger on the 'j' key and a screenful
of 'j's, I go to bed. :)
