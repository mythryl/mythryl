2012-02-20-00.30.47: Tweaking, more comments in src/A.GARBAGE-COLLECTOR.OVERVIEW.
2012-02-19-12.26.47: src/c/main/run-mythryl-code-and-runtime-eventloop.c:  Renamed run_mythryl_function -> run_mythryl_function__may_heapclean and added Roots* arg.   src/c/h/asm-base.h:  For clarity and consistency renamed LIB7_CODE_HDR -> MYTHRYL_CODE_HEADER.
2012-02-19-03.04.50: Hue White reported that compiling without libdisasm0 + libdisasm-dev packages still was not working correctly.  Fixed 12 (!) places where I had #ifdef HAVE_FOO_H in place of correct #if HAVE_FOO_H, also removed hardwired -ldisasm from src/c/o/Makefile.intel32-linux and added   AC_CHECK_LIB([disasm], [x86_init])   to   src/c/Configure.in   so  -ldisasm   will automatically appear when appropriate in   LD_LIBS2 in   src/c/o/Makefile.

2012-02-18-23.22.49: Pervasively changed 3rd arg of RELEASE_MYTHRYL_HEAP() from &arg to NULL wherever arg was dead (almost everywhere).

2012-02-18-21.50.20: src/c/h/runtime-base.h:  Change   #define RELEASE_MYTHRYL_HEAP( pthread, fn_name, arg )	release_mythryl_heap( pthread,  fn_name, &arg )   ->   #define RELEASE_MYTHRYL_HEAP( pthread, fn_name, arg )	release_mythryl_heap( pthread,  fn_name,  arg )
2012-02-18-21.33.58: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c:  release_mythryl_heap:  To make use of  arg  optional instead of mandatory, changed   pthread->task->protected_c_arg = arg;   ->   if (arg)   pthread->task->protected_c_arg = arg;
2012-02-18-21.16.16: src/c/lib/:  For clarity and consistency renamed   raise-RUNTIME_EXCEPTION.c -> raise-error.c, win32-raise-syserr.c -> raise-error-win32.c

2012-02-07-23.10.55: src/c/heapcleaner/heapclean-n-agegroups.c: Killed a goto. Why is it that functional-programming profs write the dirtiest, least-functional C?

2012-02-05-02.36.20: src/c/o/mythryl.c: Added a new fn kernel_thinks_child_is_dead(), changed sigterm_handler() to not attempt killing child if kernel_thinks_child_is_dead(). This might(?) resolve an issue Hue White reported, namely occasionally getting  Unable to kill child in response to SIGTERM  complaints from compiler.
2012-02-05-01.23.06: src/app/makelib/main/makelib-g.pkg: Merge in Hue White's patch supporting -i commandline flag to force interactive mode.

(Using approximate_time is conservative for waking up threads but not for putting them to sleep.)
2012-02-01-04.28.44: src/c/heapcleaner/heapclean-n-agegroups.c: trim_heap: Replaced heap->agegroup0_master_buffer_bytesize by task->heap_allocation_buffer_bytesize.

2012-02-01-00.44.25: src/c/heapcleaner/call-heapcleaner.c: Switch to using   agegroup0_buffer_size_in_bytes( task )   in place of   agegroup0_master_buffer_bytesize.
2012-02-01-00.32.08: src/c/h/heap.h: Added inline fns agegroup0_usedspace_in_bytes, agegroup0_usedspace_in_words, agegroup0_buffer_size_in_bytes, agegroup0_buffer_size_in_words, based on new task->heap_allocation_buffer field.
2012-02-01-00.17.45: src/c/heapcleaner/pthread-heapcleaner-stuff.c: Initialize new task->heap_allocation_buffer field.
2012-01-31-23.49.32: src/c/h/runtime-base.h: struct task: Added   Val* heap_allocation_buffer;  field. (Currently uninitialized and unused.)
2012-01-31-23.38.02: For brevity, finally bit the bullet and pervasively renamed  multipage_ram_region -> quire.
2012-01-31-23.25.20: src/c/h/heap.h:  As a first step toward sanity, renamed agegroup0_buffer -> agegroup0_master_buffer, agegroup0_buffer_bytesize -> agegroup0_master_buffer_bytesize, since the actual per-pthread buffers are now allocated from this buffer, rather than it being used directly.
2012-01-31-22.03.38: src/c/h/heap.h:  Added inline fns  agegroup0_freespace_in_bytes(),  agegroup0_freespace_in_words().
2012-01-31-13.11.58: Minor commenting.
2012-01-31-03.33.35: src/c/heapcleaner/heapclean-agegroup0.c: Minor tidying.
2012-01-31-03.14.00: src/c/heapcleaner/heapclean-agegroup0.c: Minor tidying.
2012-01-31-02.53.58: src/c/heapcleaner/heapclean-agegroup0.c: Minor tidying.
2012-01-31-02.39.57: src/c/heapcleaner/heapclean-agegroup0.c: Minor tidying and commenting.
2012-01-31-02.08.06: src/c/h/sibid.h: For clarity and consistency renamed  NEWSPACE_SIBID -> AGEGROUP0_SIBID.
2012-01-31-01.59.02: Minor tidying.
2012-01-31-01.06.22: src/c/heapcleaner/heapclean-agegroup0.c: Changed comment char from # -> //  (*blush*!), for clarity and consistency renamed weak_pointers_forwarded_during_cleaning -> weak_pointers_forwarded_during_heapcleaning.

2012-01-30-23.32.02: src/c/heapcleaner/heapclean-agegroup0.c: For consistency and brevity, pervasively renamed  agegroup_1 -> agegroup1.
2012-01-22-14.14.18: doc/tex/chapter-best-practices.tex, src/lib/std/src/nj/heap-debug.api: Fix nits uncovered by <<make book>>.
2012-01-22-02.41.27: src/lib/compiler/toplevel/interact/read-eval-print-loop-g.pkg: Commenting and cleaning.
2012-01-22-01.46.20: src/lib/src/scripting-unit-test.pkg: After the previous change, two scripts now return different strings. Bug? You decide. For the moment I have fixed this by defining the new result to be the correct result for the test.
2012-01-22-01.22.33: src/lib/compiler/toplevel/interact/read-eval-print-loop-g.pkg: Post-victory cleanup.
2012-01-22-01.06.44: src/lib/compiler/front/parser/raw-syntax/raw-syntax-junk.pkg: extract_toplevel_declarations: Added to pattern a raw::SOURCE_CODE_REGION_FOR_DECLARATION which I overlooked first time around. *blush*  But now it works.  By Grabthar's Hammer, the bloody thing works! :-)
2012-01-22-00.31.28: src/lib/compiler/toplevel/interact/read-eval-print-loop-g.pkg: prompt_read_evaluate_and_print_one_toplevel_mythryl_expression: Replaced  [ raw_declaration ]   with   (rsj::extract_toplevel_declarations  raw_declaration)   -- the point of the preceding code transforms.
2012-01-22-00.17.09: src/lib/compiler/toplevel/interact/read-eval-print-loop-g.pkg:  Added package rsj = raw_syntax_junk.
2012-01-22-00.07.18: src/lib/compiler/toplevel/interact/read-eval-print-loop-g.pkg: Moved guts of prompt_read_evaluate_and_print_one_toplevel_mythryl_expression() into new fn evaluate_and_print_toplevel_mythryl_declaration(), interposed a new fn evaluate_and_print_toplevel_mythryl_declarations() to interate over the (currently always length-one) list of toplevel raw-syntax declarations.
2012-01-21-23.49.06: src/lib/compiler/toplevel/interact/read-eval-print-loop-g.pkg: Some commenting etc.
2012-01-21-23.36.28: src/lib/compiler/front/parser/raw-syntax/raw-syntax-junk.pkg: extract_toplevel_declarations: Coded up first-cut implementation.
2012-01-21-22.52.51: src/lib/compiler/front/parser/raw-syntax/raw-syntax-junk.pkg: Squish more bloodybedamned 'include' statements -- syntactic cockroaches.
2012-01-21-22.24.38: src/lib/compiler/front/parser/raw-syntax/raw-syntax-junk.pkg:  Tidying.
2012-01-21-22.14.48: src/lib/compiler/front/parser/raw-syntax/raw-syntax-junk.pkg:  extract_toplevel_declarations():  Commenting.
2012-01-21-21.52.52: src/lib/compiler/front/parser/raw-syntax/raw-syntax-junk.api:  Add  extract_toplevel_declarations().
2012-01-21-21.20.37: src/lib/compiler/front/parser/raw-syntax/raw-syntax-junk.api: Renamed exn_id -> exception_id for the greater glory of God, Country, Saint George and Maranatha Peanut Butter.
2012-01-21-21.00.59: Minor tidying.
2012-01-21-02.21.48: src/c/lib/date/strftime.c: Changed size+1 -> size, fixing a bug I introduced 2011-11-19.
2012-01-21-02.02.50: Tidying.
2012-01-21-01.55.49: src/lib/core/internal/mythryld-app.pkg: main: Added   file::set_logger_to  (file::LOG_TO_FILE "unknown.log");  call because attempts to log during script runs were drawing attempt-to-write-to-closed-stream errors.
2012-01-21-01.13.22: Fix compile errors overlooked in previous check-ins. *blush*
2012-01-20-15.28.54: src/lib/compiler/toplevel/interact/read-eval-print-loop-g.pkg: read_eval_print_loop: For clarity changed arg from tuple to record { sourcecode_info, keep_looping }.
2012-01-20-15.19.39: src/lib/compiler/toplevel/interact/read-eval-print-loop-g.pkg: with_error_handling: For clarity, changed first curried arg from Bool to { treat_as_user: Bool }.
2012-01-20-15.04.46: Minor tidying.
2012-01-20-14.50.41: src/lib/core/internal/mythryld-app.pkg: For clarity, renamed  script -> script_name.
2012-01-20-14.14.21: src/lib/std/src/nj/runtime-profiling-control.pkg: For clarity renamed  foo__profile_index -> foo__cpu_user_index for all relevant foo.
2012-01-20-13.37.44: src/lib/std/src/nj/runtime-profiling-control.pkg: For clarity renamed  foo_profile_index -> foo__profile_index for all relevant foo.
2012-01-20-13.22.01: src/lib/std/src/nj/runtime-profiling-control.pkg: For clarity renamed  runtime_index -> in_runtime_profile_index (etc).
2012-01-03-05.19.58: src/c/heapcleaner/heap-debug-stuff.c: check_agegroup0_overrun_tripwire_buffer: Disabled this check until I have time to get back to it.
2012-01-02-03.15.18: src/c/heapcleaner/make-package-literals-via-bytecode-interpreter.c: make_package_literals_via_bytecode_interpreter:  Rename stk -> stack throughout. (Where do these people come from?)
2012-01-02-03.08.47: src/c/heapcleaner/heap-debug-stuff.c:  dump_ramlog__guts:  Fix the *other* place where I had AGEGROUP0_OVERRUN_TRIPWIRE_BUFFER_SIZE_IN_WORDS instead of RAMLOG_ENTRIES.
2012-01-01-14.12.33: src/c/heapcleaner/heap-debug-stuff.c:  dump_ramlog__guts:  Bugfix: Had AGEGROUP0_OVERRUN_TRIPWIRE_BUFFER_SIZE_IN_WORDS where RAMLOG_ENTRIES was needed.
2012-01-01-14.02.10: Makefile: summary:  To reduce console clutter changed   @ls ... to  @find . -type f -maxdepth 1 -name 'dump*log' -ls
2012-01-01-13.53.56: Makefile: summary:  Added   @ls -l dump*log   to reduce chance of missing tripwire dumps.
2012-01-01-13.49.05: make_package_literals_via_bytecode_interpreter: Added check_agegroup0_overrun_tripwire_buffer() calls at top and bottom because a pair of Heisenbug dumplogs seemed to finger it as a tripwirebuffer-clobbering culprint. (The Heisenbug promptly vanished, of course...)
2012-01-01-13.31.53: src/c/heapcleaner/heap-debug-stuff.c: dump_ramlog__guts: Switched to display in reverse chronological order, which is handier in practice because one usually cares about only the last couple of calls, and arrives at that dumplog section by searching for the header.
2012-01-01-13.24.28: src/c/heapcleaner/heap-debug-stuff.c: dump_gen0_tripwire_buffers__guts: Suppressed minor type complaints due to previous.'
2011-12-31-13.52.22: src/c/heapcleaner/heap-debug-stuff.c: dump_gen0_tripwire_buffers__guts: Switched to display dripwire buffer using *both* hexdump_to_file() and list-of-hex-ints formats. Life is short -- live large! :-)
2011-12-31-12.48.54: src/c/heapcleaner/heap-debug-stuff.c: dump_gen0_tripwire_buffers__guts: Switched to using hexdump_to_file() to display tripwire buffer contents.
2011-12-31-12.30.32: src/c/heapcleaner/heap-debug-stuff.c: check_agegroup0_overrun_tripwire_buffer: Corrected off-by-one-error in reporting number of tripwire buffer words overwritten.
2011-12-31-12.20.00: src/c/heapcleaner/heap-debug-stuff.c: open_heapdump_logfile: Dropped a redundant <<dump>> from prefix.
2011-12-30-16.53.11: src/c/machine-dependent/posix-arithmetic-trap-handlers.c: Minor polishing.
2011-12-30-16.11.40: src/c/mythryl-config.h: Dropped HAVE_LIBDISASM in favor of:  src/c/Configure.in:  Added   AC_CHECK_HEADERS([libdis.h])   src/c/heapcleaner/heap-debug-stuff.c:  Made use of libdisasm conditional on HAVE_LIBDIS_H from src/c/config.h in place of HAVE_LIBDISASM. Virtue triumphs over laziness! :-)
2011-12-30-15.28.49: src/c/heapcleaner/heap-debug-stuff.c: Made libdisasm stuff conditional on HAVE_LIBDISASM.
2011-12-30-14.15.24: src/c/machine-dependent/posix-arithmetic-trap-handlers.c: Modified arithmetic_fault_handler() to call dump_all() before die()ing.
2011-12-30-14.00.48: src/c/heapcleaner/heap-debug-stuff.c:  check_agegroup0_overrun_tripwire_buffer:  Changed to call to   dump_all_but_hugechunks_contents()   before die()ing.
2011-12-30-13.51.46: src/lib/std/src/nj/heap-debug.api: Added dump_gen0_tripwire_buffers.
2011-12-30-13.43.21: src/c/heapcleaner/heap-debug-stuff.c:  Added dump_gen0_tripwire_buffers().
2011-12-30-13.12.15: src/c/heapcleaner/heap-debug-stuff.c:  Tidying.
2011-12-30-13.01.09: src/lib/std/src/nj/heap-debug.api: Split dump_huge() into dump_hugechunks_contents() + dump_hugechunks_summary();  Changed dump_all_but_huge() to dump_all_but_hugechunks_contents().
2011-12-30-05.15.01: src/lib/std/src/nj/heap-debug.api:  Added dump_all(), dump_all_but_huge().
2011-12-30-04.48.08: src/lib/std/src/nj/heap-debug.api: Added dump_gen0s().
2011-12-30-02.54.22: src/lib/std/src/nj/heap-debug.api:  Added dump_ramlog().

2011-12-30-02.38.40: src/c/heapcleaner/heap-debug-stuff.c: Added dump_ramlog().
2011-12-29-20.17.32: src/c/h/runtime-base.h: Sketched in first-cut version of ramlog.
2011-12-29-19.53.23: Indented ENTER_MYTHRYL_CALLABLE_C_FN calls to reduce visual clutter.
2011-12-29-19.34.18: Pervasively added ENTER_MYTHRYL_CALLABLE_C_FN() calls where appropriate, to the tune of about 267 places.
2011-12-29-13.52.48: src/c/h/runtime-base.h:  Added   ENTER_MYTHRYL_CALLABLE_C_FN   macro, with null definition. (Decided a matching ENTER_MYTHRYL_CALLABLE_C_FN macro would be just clutter for now, and resisted the temptation.)
2011-12-28-20.25.02: src/A.GDB-ON-MYTHRYL-SCRIPTS.OVERVIEW:  Updated again.
2011-12-28-19.53.55: src/A.GDB-ON-MYTHRYL-SCRIPTS.OVERVIEW:  Updated.
2011-12-28-19.19.02: src/A.GDB-ON-MYTHRYL-SCRIPTS.OVERVIEW: Created, to document the process, filled with first-cut description.  src/c/lib/heap/libmythryl-heap.c: Removed the 'static' qualifiers from breakpoint_0 ... breakpoint_9 fns so they would be visible to gdb.  *blush*
2011-12-28-02.39.51: src/lib/compiler/toplevel/interact/read-eval-print-loop-g.pkg: read_eval_print_from_script: Actually use supplied file_name arg. :-)

2011-12-28-00.03.40: src/c/o/mythryl.c: Dropped support for the MYTHRYL_MODE=SCRIPT environment var replaced by MYTHRYL_SCRIPT=<stdin>.
2011-12-27-23.47.28: Deleted src/c/o/mythryl.c.bad-idea to reduce clutter.  src/c/o/mythryl.c: Changed from MYTHRYL_MODE=TRUE -> MYTHRYL_SCRIPT=<stdin> for increased (potential) flexibility.
2011-12-27-23.33.20: src/lib/core/internal/mythryld-app.pkg: Added support for MYTHRYL_SCRIPT=<stdin> as a functional replacement for MYTHRYL_MODE=SCRIPT.
2011-12-27-22.59.48: src/c/o/Makefile.intel32-linux: Added -g to CFLAGS to support use with gdb -- runtime penality is reputed to be minimal.
2011-12-27-22.01.53: src/c/main/runtime-main.c: Dropped support for 'mythryl-runtime-ia32', obsolete name for 'mythryl-runtime-intel32'.
2011-12-27-21.45.59: src/c/main/runtime-main.c: Dropped support for 'runtime7', obsolete name for 'mythryl-runtime-intel32'.
2011-12-27-20.20.49: src/app/makelib/main/makelib-g.pkg, src/app/makelib/tools/main/private-makelib-tools.pkg: Dropped support for obsoleted .make6 file extension (replaced by .lib and .sublib).
2011-12-27-13.43.03: src/lib/std/src/nj/heap-debug.api: Added dump_whatever(), breakpoint_0() ... breakpoint_1().
2011-12-27-13.01.08: src/c/lib/heap/libmythryl-heap.c: Added do_dump_whatever(), do_breakpoint_0(), ... , do_breakpoint_9().
2011-12-27-02.13.45: Debian packages libdisasm0 + libdisasm-dev are now required to build and link Mythryl.  Moved hexdump-if.h to src/c/h/hexdump-if.h. Move hexdump-if.c to src/c/heapcleaner/hexdump-if.c.  In src/c/heapcleaner/heap-debug-stuff.c changed dump_hugechunk_stuff() to disassemble dumped code via libdisasm0.
2011-12-26-01.17.21: src/c/heapcleaner/heap-debug-stuff.c: dump_hugechunk: Change to show absolute (rather than relative) memory addresses in hexdumps.
2011-12-25-23.55.46: src/c/heapcleaner/heap-debug-stuff.c: Hexdump contents of hugechunks (==code).
2011-12-25-23.40.20: src/c/lib/socket/hexdump-if.c: Added hexdump_to_file() call.
2011-12-25-23.19.17: src/c/lib/socket/hexdump-if.c: hexdump_if() was hardwired to write to the int fd log_if_fd.  Split off the core logic into a more use-agnostic fn hexdump(), and changed hexdump_if() to be a simple wrapper for hexdump().
2011-12-25-10.41.28: src/c/heapcleaner/heap-debug-stuff.c: dump_hugechunk_stuff: Added hugechunk_region listing.
2011-12-24-15.48.10: src/lib/std/src/nj/heap-debug.api:  Added dump_hugechunk_stuff().
2011-12-24-02.41.47: src/c/heapcleaner/heap-debug-stuff.c: More output tweaking for improved readability.
2011-12-24-02.05.06: Renamed change-log -> change-history because I absentmindedly nuked change-log by doing a   rm *log.
2011-12-24-01.55.44: src/c/heapcleaner/heap-debug-stuff.c: dump_pair_sib: Added newline between each pair for improved readability.
2011-12-24-01.42.36: src/c/heapcleaner/: Did   tr '\r' '\n'   on src/c/heapcleaner/heapclean-agegroup0.c, which also seemed to have suffered Mac trauma.
2011-12-24-01.27.41: src/c/heapcleaner/heap-debug-stuff.c, src/lib/std/src/nj/heap-debug.api: Renamed dump_gen1 -> dump_gens, tweaked it to dump generations 1-N (last active) instead of just gen1.
2011-12-24-00.32.09: src/c/heapcleaner/heap-debug-stuff.c: First-cut implementions of dump_record_sib(), dump_pair_sib(), dump_string_sib(), dump_vector_sib().

2011-12-23-22.42.20: src/lib/std/src/nj/heap-debug.api, src/c/heapcleaner/heap-debug-stuff.c: Added framework for dump_gen1() parallel to dump_gen0().
2011-12-23-19.13.33: src/c/heapcleaner/heap-debug-stuff.c: Tweaking.
2011-12-23-18.18.29: src/c/heapcleaner/heap-debug-stuff.c: Tweaking.
2011-12-23-14.29.49: src/lib/std/src/nj/weak-reference.api: Renaming for clarity.  src/c/heapcleaner/heap-debug-stuff.c:  log_gen0: Added blank lines between records for readability.
2011-12-23-13.48.54: src/c/heapcleaner/heap-debug-stuff.c: Rewrote to write dumps to separate files, to improve readability of main logfile and facilitating before-and-after grepping of dumps.
2011-12-23-11.26.57: Did   tr '\r' '\n'   on   src/c/lib/heap/libmythryl-heap.c.  (Someone must have been editing it on a Mac at some point.)
2011-12-23-01.31.14: src/lib/std/src/nj/heap-debug.api:  Added disable_debug_logging(), enable_debug_logging().
2011-12-23-01.09.54: src/lib/std/src/nj/heap-debug.api:  Added log_gen0().
2011-12-23-00.53.35: src/lib/std/src/nj/heap-debug.api: Added log_task().
2011-12-23-00.35.43: src/c/lib/heap/libmythryl-heap.c: Added log_task().
2011-12-23-00.16.32: src/c/lib/heap/libmythryl-heap.c: More minor cleanup.
2011-12-22-21.09.39: Created src/lib/std/src/nj/heap-debug.api, populated it by moving check_agegroup0_overrun_tripwire_buffer over from src/lib/std/src/nj/heapcleaner-control.api, where it did not really belong.
2011-12-22-20.51.03: Renamed src/c/heapcleaner/heapcleaner-debug-stuff.c -> src/c/heapcleaner/heap-debug-stuff.c because it is more about the heap than the heapcleaner.
2011-12-22-18.15.57: c/lib/heap/libmythryl-heap.c: More of the same.
2011-12-22-17.35.38: c/lib/heap/libmythryl-heap.c: Folded all the fun-per-file stuff into this file for ease of reading and to reduce global namespace clutter.
2011-12-22-12.40.06: Trivial fix to previous checkin.
2011-12-22-12.35.31: Established src/c/heapcleaner/heapcleaner-debug-stuff.c as a forward firebase for the Heisenbug Wars, seeding it with log_task(), zero_agegroup0_overrun_tripwire_buffer() and check_agegroup0_overrun_tripwire_buffer() from src/c/heapcleaner/heapcleaner-stuff.c.
2011-12-21-12.54.30: src/c/lib/pthread/libmythryl-pthread.c: mutex_trylock: Fixed trivial bug introduced during previous change.
2011-12-21-11.41.11: src/c/lib/pthread/libmythryl-pthread.c: Added more log_if()ing for debug support.
2011-12-20-20.51.22: Replaced Heisenbug-hunt calls to heapcleaner_control::clean_heap with calls to heapcleaner_control::check_agegroup0_overrun_tripwire_buffer because I was calling the former only to trigger the latter, which is a much less disruptive way of tracking heap corruption problems.
2011-12-20-20.15.33: src/lib/std/src/nj/heapcleaner-control.pkg: Added check_agegroup0_overrun_tripwire_buffer(), completing Mythryl-level access to src/c/lib/heap/check-agegroup0-overrun-tripwire-buffer.c.
2011-12-20-19.37.32: src/c/lib/heap/check-agegroup0-overrun-tripwire-buffer.c: Created, to provide Mythryl-level access to new check_agegroup0_overrun_tripwire_buffer() call in src/c/heapcleaner/heapcleaner-stuff.c.
2011-12-19-23.56.41: Minor Heisenbug-trap tuning and commenting.
2011-12-19-17.48.38: src/c/heapcleaner/heapcleaner-stuff.c: Move log_task() here from src/c/heapcleaner/heapclean-agegroup0.c, export it for general use.
2011-12-19-17.40.51: src/c/heapcleaner/heapcleaner-stuff.c: zero_out_agegroup0_overrun_tripwire_buffer(): Call log_if after zeroing out buffer.
2011-12-19-17.33.00: src/c/heapcleaner/heapcleaner-stuff.c: Moved zero_out_agegroup0_overrun_tripwire_buffer() and validate_agegroup0_overrun_tripwire_buffer() over from src/c/heapcleaner/pthread-heapcleaner-stuff.c.
2011-12-19-17.17.21: src/c/heapcleaner/pthread-heapcleaner-stuff.c: To watch for possible heap_allocation_limit overrun, added zero_out_agegroup0_overrun_tripwire_buffer() and validate_agegroup0_overrun_tripwire_buffer().
2011-12-19-12.56.37: src/c/heapcleaner/heapclean-agegroup0.c: Added log_task() to aid in Heisenbug hunting.
2011-12-13-17.48.24: src/lib/std/src/pthread-unit-test.pkg:  Added verify_that_basic_condition_variable_stuff_works () fn + call.
2011-12-13-04.17.24: src/c/lib/pthread/libmythryl-pthread.c: Was failing to update condvar->state appropriately in condition-variable fns.  Fixed.
2011-12-13-02.28.10: src/lib/std/src/pthread-unit-test.pkg: Added script and C code documenting current condition-variable problem.
2011-12-12-00.45.39: src/c/main/runtime-main.c: Added  Bool running_script  variable.
2011-12-12-00.05.21: src/c/main/runtime-main.c: Added  Bool saw_shebang_line  variable.
2011-12-11-23.44.14: src/c/heapcleaner/heapcleaner-initialization.c: For clarity and consistency renamed handle_cleaner_commandline_arguments -> handle_heapcleaner_commandline_arguments.
2011-12-11-23.33.30: For consistency and clarity, pervasively renamed mythryl-runtime-ia32 -> mythryl-runtime-intel32.
2011-12-11-18.47.58: src/c/main/runtime-main.c: Added logic to recognize /mythryl-runtime-intel32 as equivalent to mythryl-runtime-ia32 (the former is more consistent with the codebase generally).
2011-12-11-15.28.59: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c:  release_mythryl_heap: Was calling pthread_cond_signal() where pthread_cond_broadcast() was intended.  Fixed.
2011-12-11-12.55.44: README: Updated per Michele Bini's listpost.
2011-12-06-02.03.18: src/lib/std/src/pthread-unit-test.pkg:  Added verify_barrier_wait_return_value () fn + call.
2011-12-06-01.50.50: src/lib/std/src/pthread-unit-test.pkg:  Added verify_that_basic_barrier_wait_works () fn + call.
2011-12-06-01.23.52: src/c/lib/pthread/libmythryl-pthread.c: Was failing to update barrier->state appropriately in barrier fns.  Fixed.
2011-12-06-00.14.39: src/lib/std/src/pthread.pkg: try_mutex:  Had the boolean condition backwards.  Fixed.
2011-12-05-23.45.23: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c: pth__pthread_join was incorrectly failing if thread-to-join had pthread->mode == PTHREAD_IS_VOID. Fixed.
2011-12-05-13.49.07: src/c/lib/pthread/libmythryl-pthread.c: Mutex fns were failing to update mutex->state appropriately on success. Fixed.
2011-12-05-04.25.49: src/A.PTHREAD-SUPPORT.OVERVIEW: Added idea of having threadkit scheduler publish runnable-threads count and next-wakeup-time for sleeping threads, so that fd_input_pthread can stop generating 100Hz timeslicing events when not needed.
2011-12-05-01.45.54: src/lib/std/src/pthread-unit-test.pkg: Added verify_that_basic_spawn_and_join_are_working().
2011-12-04-17.11.40: src/A.PTHREAD-SUPPORT.OVERVIEW: Add idea of using a timeout in the fd_input_pthread to drive threadkit timeslicing. This can give us accurate 100Hz timeslicing (and an approximate time-of-day value) without messing with SIGALRM or subprocesses.
2011-11-30-17.52.35: src/lib/core/internal/mythryl-compiler-version.pkg: Bumped version to 6.1.0 in honor of pthread support coding completion.
2011-11-29-20.24.26: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c: pth__barrier*(): Added RELEASE/RECOVER wrappers around the syscalls.
2011-11-29-19.55.50: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c: pth__condvar*(): Added RELEASE/RECOVER wrappers around the syscalls.
2011-11-29-19.31.33: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c: pth__mutex*(): Added RELEASE/RECOVER wrappers around the syscalls.
2011-11-29-03.26.17: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c:  Because these two are all I intend to use at the C level, renamed  pth__pthread_mode_mutex -> pth__mutex  and  pth__pthread_mode_condvar -> pth__condvar.
2011-11-29-03.05.57: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c: pth__pthread_exit(), pth__pthread_join(): Update task->pthread->mode and pth__running_pthreads_count and broadcast the statechange.
2011-11-29-02.52.17: src/c/heapcleaner/make-strings-and-vectors-etc.c: Replaced all uses of pth__make_strings_and_vectors_mutex by pth__pthread_mode_mutex. src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c:  Eliminated pth__make_strings_and_vectors_mutex, simplifying analysis by eliminating another potential source of deadlock.
2011-11-29-02.37.24: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c: Replaced all actual uses of UNUSED_INT_REFCELL__GLOBAL with pth__running_pthreads_count -- I much prefer keeping this stuff strictly at the C level.
2011-11-29-02.06.11: Globally renamed active_pthreads_count_refcell__global -> unused_int_refcell__global.
2011-11-29-01.56.42: Globally renamed ACTIVE_PTHREADS_COUNT_REFCELL__GLOBAL -> UNUSED_INT_REFCELL__GLOBAL.
2011-11-29-01.44.14: src/lib/core/init/runtime.api, src/lib/core/init/runtime.pkg: Renamed active_pthreads_count_refcell__global -> unused_int_refcell__global because this stuff should not be exported to the Mythryl level at all, and if exported, it should be exported via a function interface (which can do locking and logging as appropriate), not by exporting a refcell.
2011-11-29-01.04.52: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c:  Eliminated pth__get_active_pthread_count(), an awful hack which is no longer needed -- good riddance!
2011-11-29-00.55.31: src/c/heapcleaner/call-heapcleaner.c: Fixed 'unused variable Val* p' compiler nit.
2011-11-29-00.46.26: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c:  Eliminated pth__done_pthread_create flag to simplify the code, since it wound up being permanently TRUE anyhow.
2011-11-27-20.22.18: src/c/heapcleaner/pthread-heapcleaner-stuff.c: Basically totally rewrote this file per new design doc. Dropped the now-obsoleted mutexes and barrier used by the old code. Oddly, the system still works...
2011-11-27-18.02.42: Cleaned crud out of sourcetree root directory.
2011-11-27-17.52.04: src/c/heapcleaner/pthread-heapcleaner-stuff.c: For clarity and consistency renamed pth__call_heapcleaner_with_extra_roots -> pth__start_heapcleaning_with_extra_roots.
2011-11-27-13.48.34: src/c/heapcleaner/pthread-heapcleaner-stuff.c: Commenting.
2011-11-27-13.44.36: src/c/heapcleaner/call-heapcleaner.c: Tidying.
2011-11-27-13.02.14: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c: Final(?) tweaks on design doc.
2011-11-27-12.47.14: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c: More work on design doc.
2011-11-27-11.37.06: src/c/h/runtime-base.h: For clarityd PTHREAD_IS_HEAPCLEANING mode into two submodes PTHREAD_IS_PRIMARY_HEAPCLEANER +  PTHREAD_IS_SECONDARY_HEAPCLEANER. The pthread->mode state is never checked anyhow, it is only for documentation, display and debugging, so it might as well be more informative, and the distinction between primary and secondary heapcleaning pthreads is critically important.
2011-11-26-16.44.46: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c:  Updated release_mythryl_heap() and recover_mythryl_heap() per last night's 7AM design-doc revision.
2011-11-26-05.06.53: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c:   Rewrite design-doc code in more idiomatically correct style using just pth__pthread_mode_condvar & pth__pthread_mode_mutex.
2011-11-26-04.27.48: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c:   Eliminated pth__blocked_to_running_mutex.
2011-11-26-04.19.34: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c:   Renamed pth__no_running_pthreads_condvar -> pth__pthread_mode_condvar.
2011-11-26-04.11.59: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c:  Changed type of pth__heapcleaner_state from bool (int) -> Heapcleaner_State.
2011-11-26-03.54.55: src/c/h/runtime-base.h: Established type Heapcleaner_Mode = enum { HEAPCLEANER_IS_OFF/HEAPCLEANER_IS_STARTING/HEAPCLEANER_IS_RUNNING }.
2011-11-26-03.42.53: src/c/h/runtime-base.h:  For clarity, renamed Pthread_Mode enum values from IS_RUNNING/IS_BLOCKED/IS_HEAPCLEANING/IS_VOID -> PTHREAD_IS_RUNNING/PTHREAD_IS_BLOCKED/PTHREAD_IS_HEAPCLEANING/PTHREAD_IS_VOID.
2011-11-26-03.30.52: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c:   Renamed pth__it_is_heapcleaning_time -> pth__heapcleaner_state.
2011-11-25-21.36.47: src/c/heapcleaner/pthread-heapcleaner-stuff.c: Tidying.
2011-11-25-21.19.37: src/c/h/runtime-base.h: Switched from dummy to production defs of RELEASE_MYTHRYL_HEAP/RECOVER_MYTHRYL_HEAP. Oddly, still seems to work fine...
2011-11-25-19.00.36: src/c/h/runtime-base.h: Merged in pthread-state.h, partly because I hate the latter name, mostly in pursuit of that one-stop shopping experience, if necessary at the cost of a bloated runtime-base.h
2011-11-25-16.23.43: src/c/o/Makefile.in: Added system-signals.h dependencies to force system-signals.h to be synthesized before runtime-base.h is used.
2011-11-25-12.36.47: src/c/h/runtime-base.h: Merged in task.h: Was getting 'incompletely defined struc' compiler complaint and wanted to make it more of a one-stop-shopping experience.
2011-11-25-12.10.15: src/c/h/runtime-base.h: Moved body of new RELEASE_MYTHRYL_HEAP/RECOVER_MYTHRYL_HEAP defs into new functions release_mythryl_heap/recover_mythryl_heap in src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c.
2011-11-25-11.51.19: src/c/h/runtime-base.h:  Installed design doc defs for RELEASE_MYTHRYL_HEAP and RECOVER_MYTHRYL_HEAP, currently #ifdef-ed out.
2011-11-25-03.03.20: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c:  More design doc polishing.
2011-11-25-02.51.06: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c: For brevity dropped __global suffixes because the pth__ prefixes make them redundant.
2011-11-25-02.36.14: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c: For consistency and namespace cleanliness renamed it_is_heapcleaning_time__global -> pth__it_is_heapcleaning_time__global and running_pthreads_count__global -> pth__running_pthreads_count__global.
2011-11-25-02.25.06: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c:  Moved it_is_heapcleaning_time__global and running_pthreads_count__global into this file to (with luck) share a cache-line with their governing mutex.  More work on design doc.
2011-11-25-01.41.44: src/c/heapcleaner/pthread-heapcleaner-stuff.c:  For clarity renamed heapcleaning_time__global -> it_is_heapcleaning_time__global.
2011-11-25-01.16.52: src/c/h/runtime-base.h: For clarity and consistency renamed thread-id type from Pid -> Tid.  src/c/h/pthread-state.h: For clarity and consistency renamed thread id field from pid -> tid.
2011-11-25-01.00.08: src/c/heapcleaner/pthread-heapcleaner-stuff.c: For consistency and brevity renamed running_pthreads_count -> running_pthreads_count__global and all_running_pthreads_must_enter_heapcleaning_mode -> heapcleaning_time__global.   src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c: Completed first-draft design doc.
2011-11-24-23.53.49: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c:  Added pth__no_running_pthreads_condvar__global.
2011-11-24-23.28.12: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c:  Added pth__blocked_to_running_mutex__global.
2011-11-24-23.14.28: src/c/heapcleaner/pthread-heapcleaner-stuff.c: Added running_pthreads_count global.
2011-11-24-22.10.47: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/pkg/window/draw-imp.pkg: Merge in encode_poly_point x_limit contributed by Hue White -- thanks!
2011-11-24-21.35.27: src/c/heapcleaner/call-heapcleaner.c:  Tweaked need_to_call_heapcleaner() to return TRUE if all_running_pthreads_must_enter_heapcleaning_mode is set TRUE.
2011-11-24-21.27.28: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c:  Introduced pth__pthread_mode_mutex__global.
2011-11-24-20.27.33: src/c/h/runtime-base.h: For brevity and euphony renamed Pthread_Status -> Pthread_Mode.  src/c/h/pthread-state.h:  Renamed field 'status' (now of type Pthread_Mode) to 'mode'.
2011-11-24-20.12.35: src/c/h/runtime-base.h:  Added IS_HEAPCLEANING mode to the existing IS_RUNNING/IS_BLOCKED/IS_VOID modes.
2011-11-24-20.06.01: src/c/h/runtime-base.h: For clarity and brevity renamed PTHREAD_IS_RUNNING/PTHREAD_IS_SUSPENDED/NO_PTHREAD_ALLOCATED -> IS_RUNNING/IS_BLOCKED/IS_VOID.  src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c: Extensive overview comments at bottom.

2011-11-22-22.37.44: src/c/lib/socket/connect.c:  Noticed belatedly that I had broken this back in mythryl7.110.58-2011-11-22-11 (*gaak*) breaking the X regression tests. Fixed.
2011-11-22-21.01.39: src/c/lib/socket/get-network-by-address.c:  Added RELEASE/RECOVER calls.  src/c/lib/socket/get-network-by-name.c:  Added buffer/unbuffer RELEASE/RECOVER calls.  src/c/lib/socket/get-or-set-boolean-socket-option.c:  Added RELEASE/RECOVER calls.  src/c/lib/socket/get-or-set-socket-linger-option.c:  Added RELEASE/RECOVER calls.  src/c/lib/socket/get-or-set-socket-nodelay-option.c:  Added RELEASE/RECOVER calls.  src/c/lib/socket/get-or-set-socket-rcvbuf-option.c:  Added RELEASE/RECOVER calls.  src/c/lib/socket/get-or-set-socket-sndbuf-option.c:  Added RELEASE/RECOVER calls.  src/c/lib/socket/get-protocol-by-name.c:  Added buffer/unbuffer RELEASE/RECOVER calls.  src/c/lib/socket/get-protocol-by-number.c:  Added RELEASE/RECOVER calls.  src/c/lib/socket/get-service-by-name.c:  Added buffer/unbuffer RELEASE/RECOVER calls.  src/c/lib/socket/get-service-by-port.c:  Added buffer/unbuffer RELEASE/RECOVER calls.  src/c/lib/socket/getATMARK.c:  Added RELEASE/RECOVER calls.

2011-11-20-12.31.58: src/c/lib/posix-file-system/link.c: Did the buffer/unbuffer RELEASE/RECOVER dance again.
2011-11-20-11.27.25: src/c/h/runtime-base.h:  To improve clarity, brevity and symmetry, renamed   CEASE_USING_MYTHRYL_HEAP/BEGIN_USING_MYTHRYL_HEAP -> RELEASE_MYTHRYL_HEAP/RECOVER_MYTHRYL_HEAP.
2011-11-20-10.58.06: src/c/lib/posix-file-system/openf.c (etc):  More un/buffer_mythryl_heap_value() calls.  src/c/h/runtime-base.h: More commenting.
2011-11-19-19.22.23: src/c/lib/posix-file-system/chmod.c: buffer_mythryl_heap_value + unbuffer_mythryl_heap_value calls.
2011-11-19-19.02.22: Added a few more buffer_mythryl_heap_value() + unbuffer_mythryl_heap_value() calls.
2011-11-19-14.47.14: src/c/lib/dynamic-loading/dlopen.c: Added a buffer_mythryl_heap_value.
2011-11-19-14.19.23: Added a first call to un/buffer_mythryl_heap_value, added some #include <stdio.h> lines to suppress warnings.
2011-11-19-13.55.28: For clarity globally renamed Buffered_Mythryl_Heap_Value -> Mythryl_Heap_Value_Buffer.
2011-11-19-13.44.26: src/c/main/runtime-state.c: Wrote buffer_mythryl_heap_value(), unbuffer_mythryl_heap_value() as support for fns using CEASE_USING_MYTHRYL_HEAP/BEGIN_USING_MYTHRYL_HEAP.
2011-11-19-01.18.25: src/c/h/runtime-base.h: Added third arg to CEASE_USING_MYTHRYL_HEAP, to allow protecting the fns Val arg from the garbage collector.
2011-11-18-21.31.29: Merged src/c/h/runtime-pthread.h into src/c/h/runtime-base.h because pthread support is becoming part of base functionality and flipping between the two files is becoming a nuisance.
2011-11-18-14.54.45: src/c/h/runtime-pthread.h:  Renamed  PTHREAD_IS_RUNNING -> PTHREAD_IS_RUNNING_MYTHRYL for clarity, then added new   PTHREAD_IS_RUNNING_C  mode to be set by CEASE_USING_MYTHRYL_HEAP and cleared by BEGIN_USING_MYTHRYL_HEAP.
2011-11-18-13.50.54: src/c/h/runtime-base.h: For clarity and accuracy renamed   ENTER_C_LEVEL -> CEASE_USING_MYTHRYL_HEAP  and  LEAVE_C_LEVEL -> BEGIN_USING_MYTHRYL_HEAP.
2011-11-18-13.32.33: src/c/h/runtime-base.h: Established ENTER_C_LEVEL(fn_name) and LEAVE_C_LEVEL(fn_name) macros. We will need these to keep <pthread.h> support working correctly in the presence of pthreads blocked at the C level in select() or sleep() statements or whatever -- otherwise garbage collection could block all other pthreads until the offending pthread returns.
2011-11-18-13.23.56: src/c/pthread/: Tidying, commenting, for clarity renamed   pthread-on-sgi.c -> obsolete-pthread-on-sgi.c  +   pthread-on-solaris.c -> obsolete-pthread-on-solaris.c,  deleted   pthread-on-posix-threads.c.oldstuff.
2011-11-18-11.04.18: src/lib/std/src/pthread.api: Moved  fate::make_isolated_fate  call inside the implementation so as to present a simpler API to clients (spawn_pthread arg is now Void->Void instead of fate::Fate(Void)).
2011-11-17-12.51.29: Output from first spawn_pthread() call! :-) :-) :-)   Parent:  thread id d=884225840   process id d=14036 // Child:   thread_id d=881982320   process id d=14036.
2011-11-17-11.58.28: rc/lib/std/src/pthread.api: Changed spawn_pthread from   (Void -> Void) -> Pthread   back to   fat::Fate(Void) -> Pthread   -- I have a feeling that (Void -> Void) was a really bad idea.  (I do not yet understand the underlying fate semantics.)
2011-11-17-10.51.13: For clarity and consistency, pervasively renamed  cthrow -> escape_fate.
2011-11-17-10.35.14: For clarity and consistency, pervasively renamed  cthrow -> escape_fate.
2011-11-17-10.35.14: For clarity, greppability and the greater glory of Cthulho, pervasively renamed   capture -> capture_fate  and  escape -> escape_fate.
2011-11-17-10.18.43: For clarity and greppability, pervasively renamed   isolate -> make_isolated_fate.
2011-11-16-12.03.09: src/A.PTHREAD-SUPPORT.OVERVIEW: Update.
2011-11-16-11.34.17: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c:  With preceding changes, now runs successfully with pth__done_pthread_create__global = TRUE.  (Twenty full compile cycles.)  Inexplicably, it compiles faster with it set TRUE than FALSE -- 189.005 vs 202.191 user CPU seconds. So I am leaving it set TRUE. :-)
2011-11-15-21.01.18: src/c/heapcleaner/call-heapcleaner.c:  need_to_call_heapcleaner: Changed   TAGGED_INT_TO_C_INT( SOFTWARE_GENERATED_PERIODIC_EVENTS_SWITCH_REFCELL__GLOBAL) != 0   ->   DEREF( SOFTWARE_GENERATED_PERIODIC_EVENTS_SWITCH_REFCELL__GLOBAL) == HEAP_TRUE   because the former looks like an outright bug to me.
2011-11-15-20.38.46: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c:  Comment.
2011-11-15-20.25.20: src/c/heapcleaner/call-heapcleaner.c: Same fix, different fn.  (call_heapcleaner_with_extra_roots vs call_heapcleaner. Is not rampant code reduplication wonderful?)
2011-11-15-19.48.35: src/c/heapcleaner/call-heapcleaner.c: Inserted a   *roots_ptr++ =  &task->link_register;  which appeared absent for no sane reason -- presumably 15 years of bitrot at work.
2011-11-15-19.41.33: src/c/heapcleaner/call-heapcleaner.c: Light cleaning and commenting.
2011-11-15-18.55.01: src/c/heapcleaner/pthread-heapcleaner-stuff.c: Typo fix: i_am_the_ond -> i_am_the_one.
2011-11-15-18.52.29: src/c/heapcleaner/call-heapcleaner.c:  Light tidying.
2011-11-15-18.31.39: src/c/heapcleaner/pthread-heapcleaner-stuff.c: Cleaning and commenting.
2011-11-15-18.23.58: src/c/heapcleaner/pthread-heapcleaner-stuff.c: For clarity, renamed cleaning_pthread_pid__local -> heapcleaner_pthread_pid__local.
2011-11-15-17.58.45: src/c/h/runtime-base.h: Wrapped MIN def in #ifndef MIN ... #endif to avoid compiler warnings, added matching #define of MAX.  src/c/heapcleaner/pthread-heapcleaner-stuff.c: Renamed cleaning_pthread__local -> cleaning_pthread_pid__local and changed its type from int -> Pid for accuracy, also made it volatile for good measure.
2011-11-15-17.28.22: src/c/main/timers.c: Tidying.
2011-11-15-17.13.48: src/c/h/runtime-base.h: Added MIN macro to improve code reability.
2011-11-15-16.55.38: src/c/heapcleaner/pthread-heapcleaner-stuff.c:  Tidying.
2011-11-15-16.30.11: src/c/heapcleaner/pthread-heapcleaner-stuff.c: Renamed poll_freq -> poll_interval because that is what it in fact is.
2011-11-15-12.58.22: src/c/heapcleaner/call-heapcleaner.c:  need_to_call_heapcleaner:  Changed  task->heap_allocation_limit -> HEAP_ALLOCATION_LIMIT( task->heap )  in two spots -- looks like bitrot shielded from detection by (those damned) #ifdefs.
2011-11-15-11.15.02: For consistency and greppability renamed  src/lib/core/internal/mythryld.api -> src/lib/core/internal/mythryld-app.api  and    src/lib/core/internal/mythryld.pkg -> src/lib/core/internal/mythryld-app.pkg.
2011-11-14-20.04.39: src/c/mythryl-config.h: Flipped NEED_PTHREAD_DEBUG_SUPPORT to TRUE in hope of helping track down PTHREAD issue.
2011-11-14-18.10.27: src/c/mythryl-config.h:  Defined PTHREAD_LOG_IF to eliminate lots of ugly #if NEED_PTHREAD_DEBUG_SUPPORT ... #endif linepairs.  Fixed various minor bits of bitrot thus exposed.
2011-11-14-17.35.25: Changed  #ifdef NEED_PTHREAD_DEBUG_SUPPORT -> #if NEED_PTHREAD_DEBUG_SUPPORT everywhere because dependong in #ifdef for configuration is like wearing a sign reading KICK ME.
2011-11-14-17.13.22: Globally renamed  NEED_PTHREAD_SUPPORT_DEBUG -> NEED_PTHREAD_DEBUG_SUPPORT  mostly to reduce false positives when grepping for NEED_PTHREAD_SUPPORT.
2011-11-14-17.02.42: For clarity and greppability, renamed  src/c/main/error.c -> src/c/main/error-reporting.c.
2011-11-14-16.42.33: For sanity, simplicity and orderliness, merged  src/c/lib/socket/log-if.h -> src/c/h/runtime-base.h   and   src/c/lib/socket/log-if.c -> src/c/main/error.c.
2011-11-14-15.10.58: src/c/heapcleaner/heapclean-agegroup0.c: heapclean_agegroup0: Changed   pth__done_pthread_create__global  ->  1 || pth__done_pthread_create__global.
2011-11-13-18.20.11: src/c/heapcleaner/make-strings-and-vectors-etc.c: similarly jimmied   pth__done_pthread_create__global   ->   (1 || pth__done_pthread_create__global)   in make_nonempty_ro_vector().
2011-11-13-18.11.25: src/c/heapcleaner/make-strings-and-vectors-etc.c: similarly jimmied   pth__done_pthread_create__global   ->   (1 || pth__done_pthread_create__global)   in make_nonempty_rw_vector().
2011-11-13-17.50.35: src/c/machine-dependent/posix-signal.c: SELF_PTHREAD: Similarly jimmied SELF_PTHREAD to key on   (1 || pth__done_pthread_create__global)  instead of just  pth__done_pthread_create__global.
2011-11-13-16.44.17: src/c/h/runtime-pthread.h: To zero in on source of heap corruption when pth__done_pthread_create__global, changed   pth__done_pthread_create__global  ->  1 || pth__done_pthread_create__global   in PTH__MUTEX_LOCK and PTH__MUTEX_UNLOCK.  Everything seems to work fine still.
2011-11-13-16.29.18: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c: Added a couple of comments.
2011-11-13-13.21.54: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c: pth__mutex_lock, pth__mutex_unlock: Dropped the pth__done_pthread_create__global checks because they are now done at point-of-call by the PTH__MUTEX_LOCK and PTH__MUTEX_UNLOCK macros.
2011-11-13-13.21.54: src/c/h/runtime-pthread.h: Added PTH__MUTEX_LOCK and PTH__MUTEX_UNLOCK, deployed to eliminate mutex ops so long as pth__done_pthread_create__global is FALSE.
2011-11-12-17.24.46: Uncommented (almost?) all   #if NEED_PTHREAD_SUPPORT   lines.
2011-11-12-10.08.06: src/c/heapcleaner/call-heapcleaner.c: Uncommented some of the #if NEED_HEAPCLEANER_SUPPORT lines.
2011-11-12-09.44.10: src/c/mythryl-config.h:  Set NEED_PTHREAD_SUPPORT to 1 (TRUE).  (Essentially all references to it are commented out at the moment, of course.) src/c/lib/pthread/libmythryl-pthread.c: Fixed one final consequent compiler warning, in pthread_exit_fn. (Added a dummy final return HEAP_VOID.)
2011-11-12-02.00.47: Selected additional NEED_PTHREAD_SUPPORT code snippets for compilation; fixed various resulting compile errors and warnings.
2011-11-11-10.43.09: src/c/heapcleaner/call-heapcleaner.c: Let top-of-file #if NEED_PTHREAD_SUPPORT... logic compile.
2011-11-10-23.18.57: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c:  Improved error diagnostics, fixed another compiler warning.
2011-11-10-22.49.42: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c: Fix various compiler warnings.  pth__pthread_create:  Improved error reporting.
2011-11-10-21.41.37: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c:  For clarity renamed  pthread_mutex__local -> pthread_table_mutex__local. Tidying.
2011-11-10-21.25.19: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c: First-cut implementation of pth__pthread_join.
2011-11-10-20.04.17: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c: Wrote first-cut implementation of pth__pthread_exit().  src/c/h/runtime-pthread.h:  Eliminated PTHREAD_IS_SUSPENDED from Pthread_Status enum -- I do not think the added complexity is justified, and the SML/NJ implementation "suspends" a thread by spinning in a loop, which may be ok for a 1992 lab prototype but unwelcome in a 2011 production implementation. (The idea would have been to improve benchmark performance by eliminating pthread startup/shutdown overhead, but I do not envision doing enough of that for the overhead to be an issue.)
2011-11-10-19.22.45: src/c/h/runtime-base.h: Redefine Pid as pthread_t from <pthread.h>, making it safe to:  src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c: Pass &task->pthread->pid to pthread_create call, ensuring it is set in both parent and child pthreads, thus eliminating the need to spin waiting for it to be set in child (as both sgi-mp.c and solaris-mp.c did in original SML/NJ code).
2011-11-10-13.19.28: src/lib/std/src/pthread.api, src/lib/std/src/pthread.pkg: Added entry for join_pthread.
2011-11-10-13.13.32: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c, src/c/lib/pthread/libmythryl-pthread.c: Placeholder implementation of join_pthread.
2011-11-10-12.44.25: src/lib/std/src/pthread.api: Added a Pthread type parallel to existing Barrier, Condvar and Mutex types;  changed spawn_pthread to return a Pthread value; cleared out remaining initial_datum stuff, ancient leftovers I no longer want.
2011-11-10-12.30.39: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c:  Zeroth-cut implementation of pth__pthread_create.

2011-11-08-17.03.53: src/c/lib/pthread/libmythryl-pthread.c:  Rewrote mutex_unlock to handle errors via exceptions.
2011-11-08-16.56.41: src/c/lib/pthread/libmythryl-pthread.c:  Rewrote mutex_trylock to handle errors via exceptions.
2011-11-08-16.44.15: src/c/lib/pthread/libmythryl-pthread.c:  Rewrote mutex_lock to handle errors via exceptions.
2011-11-08-16.29.17: src/c/lib/pthread/libmythryl-pthread.c:  Rewrote mutex_destroy to handle errors via exceptions.
2011-11-08-15.41.33: src/c/lib/pthread/libmythryl-pthread.c:  Rewrote mutex_init to handle errors by throwing an exception rather than die()-ing. (Primarily to facilitate unit testing.)
2011-11-08-10.51.55: src/c/lib/pthread/libmythryl-pthread.c: Renamed status fields to state for slight increase in clarity.
2011-11-07-22.54.47: src/lib/std/src/pthread.api: set_mutex, set_condvar:  Added NULL args as futureproofing.
2011-11-07-22.44.27: src/lib/std/src/pthread.pkg: Proper type for wait_on_condvar.

2011-11-07-16.58.31: src/c/lib/pthread/libmythryl-pthread.c: First-cut implementation of barrier_init().  src/lib/std/src/pthread.pkg: Proper implementation and typing for set_barrier (which calls the c-level barrier_init).
2011-11-07-16.42.18: src/c/lib/pthread/libmythryl-pthread.c: First-cut implementation of barrier_wait.  src/lib/std/src/pthread.api: Set right type for wait_on_barrier.
2011-11-07-16.31.05: src/lib/std/src/pthread.api:  Update signal_condvar and broadcast_condvar types.

2011-11-07-15.55.49: src/c/lib/pthread/libmythryl-pthread.c: Hacked up first-cut implementations of mutex_lock and mutex_unlock.
2011-11-07-15.44.06: src/lib/std/src/pthread.pkg: Much renaming of externally visible stuff for clarity, in particular foo_destroy -> clear_foo.  Updated types of clear_barrier, clear_condvar and clear_mutex to Barrier -> Void, Condvar -> Void, Mutex -> Void.
2011-11-07-15.28.19: c/lib/pthread/libmythryl-pthread.c: Did clone-and-mutate on mutex_destroy to produce first-cut implementations of barrier_destroy and condvar_destroy.
2011-11-07-15.20.51: src/c/lib/pthread/libmythryl-pthread.c:  Wrote first-cut implementation of mutex_destroy.

2011-11-07-10.59.40: src/c/lib/pthread/libmythryl-pthread.c, src/lib/std/src/pthread.pkg:  Added (dummy) entries for mutex_init, mutex_destroy, mutex_lock, mutex_unlock, mutex_trylock.
2011-11-07-00.47.06: src/c/h/runtime-pthread.h, src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c: Added new calls pth__condvar_init, pth__condvar_destroy, pth__condvar_wait, pth__condvar_signal, pth__condvar_broadcast.
2011-11-06-23.59.54: src/c/h/runtime-base.h:  Added   typedef pthread_cond_t Condvar;  parallel to previous Barrier and Mutex typedefs.  src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c:  Added (as yet unused)   Condvar  pth__unused_condvar__global = PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER;
2011-11-06-20.15.04: src/lib/std/src/pthread.api: For clarity and consistency, renamed release_pthread -> pthread_exit.
2011-11-06-19.48.51: src/lib/std/src/pthread.api:  Dropped the spinlock stuff because spinlocks sound dubious and to clear the decks; also dropped max_pthreads because it does not belong in the Mythryl api.
2011-11-06-19.23.39: src/c/lib/pthread/libmythryl-pthread.c:  For clarity and consistency renamed  acquire_pthread -> spawn_pthread.
2011-11-06-18.16.38: Moved unpacking of (thread,closure) tupled from    pth__pthread_create in src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c   to   where it belongs:   acquire_pthread in src/c/lib/pthread/libmythryl-pthread.c, the Mythryl/C interface module for pthreads.
2011-11-06-01.07.39: src/c/h/task.h: For clarity, sanity and greppability, renamed field  closure -> current_closure.
2011-11-05-23.39.27: src/c/h/task.h:  Renamed field thread -> current_thread for sanity, consistency and greppability.
2011-11-05-22.45.57: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c:  For consistency and sanity, renamed   pth__done_acquire_pthread__global -> pth__done_pthread_create__global.
2011-11-05-18.57.44: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c:  Renamed  pth__acquire_pthread -> pth__pthread_create  and  pth__release_pthread -> pth__pthread_exit  for consistency with standard posix-thread API nomenclature.
2011-11-05-18.57.44: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c: Converted old pth__get_active_pthread_count() implementation to posix-threads API to yield a valid implementation.
2011-11-05-18.41.49: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c: Redefined pth__barrier_wait() to be Bool-valued instead of void-valued, to conform with standard posix-threads API. (One thread gets a TRUE return, the rest get a FALSE return; this provides an easy way for those threads to "elect a leader" if desired.
2011-11-05-18.07.04: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c:   Eliminated pth__max_pthreads, which merely returned the value of MAX_PTHREADS.
2011-11-05-17.57.40: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c:  Renamed   pth_maybe_acquire_mutex -> pth__mutex_trylock  to match standard posix-threads api naming and re-engineered it to conform to standard semantics.
2011-11-05-17.29.06: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c: Replaced pth__free_mutex by pth__mutex_destroy  and  pth__make_mutex by pth__mutex_init  to conform to the standard posix-threads API.
2011-11-05-16.58.21: src/c/main/runtime-main.c:  Swept the end-of-world stuff out of main() and into  a new fn   do_end_of_world_stuff_and_exit,  to improve clarity and balance in main().
2011-11-05-16.33.07: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c:  Deleted   pth__clear_barrier()   because it is unused and does not correspond well to anything in the posix-threads API standard.
2011-11-05-02.52.56: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c: For clarity and consistency with underlying posix-threads library, renamed pth__acquire_mutex -> pth__mutex_lock  and  pth_release_mutex -> pth__mutex_unlock.
2011-11-05-02.43.04: src/c/heapcleaner/pthread-heapcleaner-stuff.c: Recode to ensure that barrier is initialized with pthreadcount before any pthread can reach barrier.
2011-11-05-02.10.51: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c:  Converted to posix-thread system of supplying threadcount in pth__barrier_init(), vs original codebase system of supplying threadcount in  pth__barrier_wait().
2011-11-04-22.14.50: src/c/h/runtime-pthread.h:  Removed  #define ACQUIRE_MUTEX(mutex) pth__acquire_mutex(mutex);   and   #define RELEASE_MUTEX(mutex) pth__release_mutex(mutex);   which were pure and simple obfustication.
2011-11-04-21.57.22: src/c/h/runtime-pthread.h:  Eliminated   #define BEGIN_CRITICAL_SECTION( mutex )	{ pth__acquire_mutex(mutex); {   and   #define END_CRITICAL_SECTION( mutex )	} pth__release_mutex(mutex); }   which IMHO mainly obfusticate.
2011-11-04-21.43.59: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c: Changed argtypes of pth__acquire_mutex and pth__release_mutex from Mutex to Mutex* to better match underlying posix-threads library.
2011-11-04-14.25.42: src/c/mythryl-config.h: Added URL+quote for Intel documentation on cacheline size.
2011-11-04-14.06.51: src/c/mythryl-config.h:  Added   #define CACHE_LINE_BYTESIZE 64.   pth__heapcleaner_mutex__global:  Initialized pth__heapcleaner_mutex__global, pth__heapcleaner_gen_mutex__global, pth__timer_mutex__global to PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER, added CACHE_LINE_BYTESIZE bytes of padding between them.
2011-11-04-13.35.41: src/c/main/runtime-main.c:  Moved start-of-world stuff into new   do_start_of_world_stuff()   fn to reduce clutter and improve balance in  main().
2011-11-04-12.31.12: src/c/heapcleaner/Makefile.in (and src/c/heapcleaner/makefile.win32):  Added pthread-heapcleaner-stuff.o to HEAPCLEANER_OBJS to make it compile and be available in LIB, and eliminated the parallel PTHREAD_LIB stuff, since it adds clutter and anyhow I want to make pthread support standard instead of optional.  src/c/heapcleaner/pthread-heapcleaner-stuff.c: Fixed two of my typos exposed by the resulting compile.
2011-11-04-11.49.16: src/c/heapcleaner/Makefile.in (etc):  More name rationalization and bitrot cleaning.
2011-11-04-11.37.25: src/c/heapcleaner/Makefile.in:  More name rationalization, e.g. standardizing on PTHREAD instead of MULTICORE in names.
2011-11-04-11.27.29: src/c/heapcleaner/Makefile.in:  Bitrot fixing:  <<pthread-heapcleaner-stuff>> (etc) had variously wound up as <<pthread-heapcleaning-stuff>>, <<pthread-cleaner-stuff>> etc.
2011-11-04-11.15.49: src/c/heapcleaner/heapcleaner-initialization.c: More globals renaming for clarity.
2011-11-04-11.08.35: src/c/heapcleaner/heapcleaner-initialization.c: Add __global suffix to names of four globals.
2011-11-04-10.55.58: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c:  Renamed   pth__initialize -> pth__start_up   for better symmetry with   pth__shut down.
2011-11-04-10.50.04: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c: Established placeholder versions of all exported functions just to allow dependent files (in particular   src/c/heapcleaner/pthread-heapcleaner-stuff.c) to compile.
2011-11-04-01.54.25: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c:  Added new  pth__done_acquire_pthread__global  flag, with the idea that so long as it remains FALSE we can continue to use mutex-free monothread code for heapcleaning etc.
2011-11-04-01.25.59: Globally renamed  foo_local -> foo__local  to clearly distinguish the identifier proper from the scope nametag.
2011-11-04-00.56.11: Globally renamed  FOO_GLOBAL -> FOO__GLOBAL  to clearly distinguish the identifier proper from the scope nametag.
2011-11-03-21.31.55: Globally renamed  foo_global -> foo__global  to clearly distinguish the identifier proper from the scope nametag.
2011-11-03-15.03.50: Pervasively changed pth_foo -> pth__foo to draw clearer distiction between namespace and identifier proper.
2011-11-03-14.56.43: src/c/h/runtime-pthread.h:  Added   extern Pthread* pth_get_pthread (void);   to give signal handlers a way to find the current Pthread.
2011-11-03-14.12.27: src/c/h/runtime-pthread.h:  Added   #include runtime-base.h   so as to make   Pthread   type available in this file.
2011-11-03-12.23.24: src/c/h/runtime-base.h:  Eliminated   pthread_count_global   because it turned out to just be an alias for   MAX_PTHREADS.   Eschew obfustication!  Eschew obfustication!  Eschew obfustication! :-)
2011-11-03-01.56.37: src/c/heapcleaner/call-heapcleaner.c:  Commenting.
2011-11-03-01.39.28: src/c/h/heap.h:  Renamed   clean_agegroup0 -> heapclean_agegroup0  and  clean_n_agegroups -> heapclean_n_agegroups   for consistency and to increase codebase cross-section relative to searches on 'heapclean' tieword.
2011-11-02-21.54.42: src/c/heapcleaner/call-heapcleaner.c: call_heapcleaner_with_extra_roots: Fixed latent bug inherited from SML/NJ:  They had   if (nProcs == 0) ASSIGN(ProfCurrent, PROF_RUNTIME); return;   where they needed   if (nProcs == 0) { ASSIGN(ProfCurrent, PROF_RUNTIME); return; }.
2011-11-02-21.29.53: src/c/heapcleaner/pthread-heapcleaner-stuff.c (etc):  To fix bitrot pervasively changed   task->lib7_mpSelf to task->pid.  (This is another example of #ifdefs serving as bitrot bug breeding grounds.)
2011-11-02-21.01.27: src/c/heapcleaner/call-heapcleaner.c:  Renamed  clean_heap -> call_heapcleaner  for consistency and to increase the codebase cross-section wrt searches on the tieword 'heapclean'.
2011-11-02-20.36.25: src/c/heapcleaner/call-heapcleaner.c: Renamed clean_heap_with_extra_roots -> call_heapcleaner_with_extra_roots to increase cross-section to 'heapclean'' tieword.
2011-11-02-19.42.40: src/c/machine-dependent/prim*asm:  Renamed call_heapcleaner -> call_heapcleaner_asm (etc) for clarity and to free up the call_heapcleaner identifier for use in src/c/heapcleaner/call-heapcleaner.c.
2011-11-02-00.54.22: src/c/heapcleaner/pthread-heapcleaner-stuff.c:  For consistency renamed  mc_clean_heap_with_extra_roots -> pth_clean_heap_with_extra_roots.
2011-11-01-22.52.23: src/c/heapcleaner/call-heapcleaner.c:  Changed   #if (NEED_PTHREAD_SUPPORT && defined(COMMENT_MULTICORE_SUPPORT_FOR_SOFTWARE_GENERATED_PERIODIC_EVENTS)) -> #if (NEED_PTHREAD_SUPPORT && NEED_PTHREAD_SUPPORT_FOR_SOFTWARE_GENERATED_PERIODIC_EVENTS).  (Looks like a typo I introduced at some point.)
2011-11-01-22.38.48: src/c/heapcleaner/call-heapcleaner.c: For clarity, consistency and accuracy renamed  need_to_clean_heap -> need_to_call_heapcleaner.  (It does not always return TRUE because the heap needs cleaning; sometimes it returns TRUE to trigger software-generated event processing.)
2011-11-01-22.01.03: src/c/mythryl-config.h:  Added   #define NEED_PTHREAD_SUPPORT_FOR_SOFTWARE_GENERATED_PERIODIC_EVENTS 0   and pervasively changed   #ifdef PTHREAD_SUPPORT_FOR_SOFTWARE_GENERATED_PERIODIC_EVENTS   to   #if NEED_PTHREAD_SUPPORT_FOR_SOFTWARE_GENERATED_PERIODIC_EVENTS.
2011-11-01-21.32.27: src/c/mythryl-config.h:  Commenting and cleaning.
2011-11-01-21.20.54: src/c/mythryl-config.h:  Added   #define NEED_HUGECHUNK_REFERENCE_STATISTICS 0   and pervasively changed   #ifdef KEEP_HUGECHUNK_REFERENCE_STATISTICS   to  #if NEED_HUGECHUNK_REFERENCE_STATISTICS   in   src/c/heapcleaner/heapclean-n-agegroups.c.
2011-11-01-21.09.26: src/c/heapcleaner/: For clarity and consistency, renamed   clean-agegroup0.c -> heapclean-agegroup0.c   and   clean-n-agegroups.c -> heapclean-n-agegroups.c.
2011-11-01-20.57.53: src/c/mythryl-config.h: Added   #define NEED_HEAPCLEANER_PAUSE_STATISTICS 0   and pervasively changed   #ifdef KEEP_HEAPCLEANER_PAUSE_STATISTICS   to   #if NEED_HEAPCLEANER_PAUSE_STATISTICS.
2011-11-01-20.11.17: Random renaming/commenting/cleaning of pthread-related stuff.
2011-11-01-19.44.45: src/c/heapcleaner/: For clarity renamed pthread-cleaning-stuff.c -> pthread-heapcleaner-stuff.c
2011-11-01-19.21.49: sh/make-c-stuff: This had a paragraph setting up GC_GEN0_BUFSIZE based on mips vs intel32 vs alpha32 architectures, but GC_GEN0_BUFSIZE was never again referenced, and in any event CPU chip proliferation has made nonsense of the idea -- deleted the paragraph.
2011-11-01-18.05.27: src/c/mythryl-config.h:  Flipped NEED_SOFTWARE_GENERATED_PERIODIC_EVENTS from 0 to 1 (i.e., FALSE to TRUE) because the pthread support requires it, recompiled, fixed the bitrot thus revealed, e.g. allocBase had become agegroup0_buffer but that substitution had not been made everywhere.  This is the sucky side of using #ifdefs -- it provides little nests for bitrot bugs to breed in.
2011-11-01-15.21.14: src/c/mythryl-config.h:  For clarity and accuracy, pervasively changed WANT_FOO to NEED_FOO.
2011-11-01-15.14.54: src/c/mythryl-config.h:  Added   #define WANT_SOFTWARE_GENERATED_PERIODIC_EVENTS 0   and pervasively changed   #ifdef SOFTWARE_GENERATED_PERIODIC_EVENTS   to   #if WANT_SOFTWARE_GENERATED_PERIODIC_EVENTS
2011-11-01-14.17.11: src/c/h/runtime-pthread.h:  For clarity and consistency, changed 'lock' to 'mutex' throughout.
2011-11-01-13.42.29: src/c/machine-dependent/posix-signal.c (etc): To forestall possible silent memory corruption, added if (sig >= MAX_POSIX_SIGNALS)    die (<<posix-signal.c: c_signal_handler: sig d=%d >= MAX_POSIX_SIGNAL %d
>>, sig, MAX_POSIX_SIGNALS );
2011-10-31-01.13.21: Established  src/lib/std/src/pthread-unit-test.pkg  and hooked it up.
2011-10-31-00.46.22: After some file to fit / bash to shape / paint to cover on src/c/heapcleaner/Makefile.in, src/c/o/Makefile.in etc, eval: pthread::get_pthread_id(); now runs correctly, which basically verifies that src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c and src/c/lib/pthread/libmythryl-pthread.c are being successfully compiled and linked into the makefile maze.
2011-10-29-20.50.43: Moved MAX_PTHREAD from  c/h/runtime-configuration.h  to  src/c/mythryl-config.h  because it is a critical configuration parameter and I want to collect those in the latter.
2011-10-29-20.32.19: Pervasively changed  #ifdef MULTICORE_SUPPORT  to  #if WANT_PTHREAD_SUPPORT.
2011-10-29-16.19.28: src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c: Add   #include <pthread.h>   to file.
2011-10-28-19.36.40: src/c/o/Makefile.in: Changed  LIBMULTICORE_OBJS = 'OBJS=$$(SGI_OBJS)'  ->  LIBMULTICORE_OBJS = 'OBJS=$$(POSIX_THREADS_OBJS)'.  SGI_OBJS is pthread-sgi.o, old code depending on SGI hardware from the early 1990s;  POSIX_THREADS_OBJS is pthread-on-posix-threads.o, which will be an implementation based on the modern posix-threads API (which was first defined in 1996).
2011-10-28-19.25.08: Created src/c/mythryl-config.h -- the idea is that src/c/config.h is synthesized by gnu autoconf and records resource availability via HAVE_FOO #defines, whereas src/c/mythryl-config.h is manually mantained and records policy decisions via WANT_FOO #defines.  All .c files now #include src/c/mythryl-config.h, which then in turn #includes src/c/config.h.
2011-10-28-19.03.56: src/c/lib/pthread/:  Combined the pre-existing files libmythryl-pthread.c, cfun-list.h, cfun-proto-list.h, max-pthreads.c, release-pthread.c and spin-lock.c into a single file libmythryl-pthread.c.  This is less mickeymouse, more maintaianble, and declutters the global namespace by making all the functions static (local) instead of global.
2011-10-28-18.11.07: src/c/h/runtime-pthread.h: For sanity and consistency, changed mc_ (multicore) prefixes to pth_ (pthread).
2011-10-28-17.44.52: src/c/h/pthread-state.h: Changed 'struct pthread' -> 'struct pthread_state_struct' to reduce potential for conflict with <pthread.h> header stuff.
2011-10-28-17.20.47: Renamed  src/c/h/pthread.h -> src/c/h/pthread-state.h  to reduce potential for confusion with <pthread.h> header file.
2011-10-28-17.10.27: Did a clone-and-rename on  src/c/pthread/pthread-on-sgi.c  to produce zeroth-order   src/c/pthread/pthread-on-posix-threads.c  file.
2011-10-28-16.08.23: For clarity and consistency renamed  src/c/pthread/sgi-multicore.c -> src/c/pthread/pthread-on-sgi.c.
2011-10-28-15.58.40: For clarity and consistency renamed  src/c/pthread/solaris-multicore.c -> src/c/pthread/pthread-on-solaris.c.
2011-10-28-15.44.33: For clarity and consistency renamed  src/c/h/runtime-multicore.h -> src/c/h/runtime-pthread.h.
2011-10-28-15.36.46: For consistency (if not perhaps clarity) renamed  src/lib/std/src/posix-thread.api -> src/lib/std/src/pthread.api  and    src/lib/std/src/posix-thread.pkg -> src/lib/std/src/pthread.pkg.   src/c/lib/pthread/cfun-list.h:  Changed CLIB_NAME string from multicore to pthread.
2011-10-28-13.40.13: For clarity and consistency renamed  src/c/heapcleaner/multicore-cleaning-stuff.c -> src/c/heapcleaner/pthread-cleaning-stuff.c  and  src/c/lib/pthread/libmythryl-multicore.c -> src/c/lib/pthread/libmythryl-pthread.c.
2011-10-28-13.08.22: For clarity and consistency renamed  src/c/h/cleaner.h -> src/c/h/heapcleaner.h.
2011-10-28-12.57.45: For clarity and consistency renamed  src/c/heapcleaner/cleaner-statistics.h -> src/c/heapcleaner/heapcleaner-statistics.h  and  src/c/h/cleaner-statistics-2.h -> src/c/h/heapcleaner-statistics-2.h.
2011-10-28-12.41.06: For clarity and consistency renamed  src/c/heapcleaner/cleaner-initialization.c -> src/c/heapcleaner/heapcleaner-initialization.c.
2011-10-28-12.27.02: For clarity and consistency renamed  src/c/heapcleaner/cleaner-stuff.c -> src/c/heapcleaner/heapcleaner-stuff.c.
2011-10-28-12.13.24: For clarity and consistency renamed  src/c/heapcleaner/call-cleaner.c -> src/c/heapcleaner/call-heapcleaner.c.
2011-10-28-12.05.48: For clarity and consistency renamed  src/c/lib/heap/cleaner-control.c -> src/c/lib/heap/heapcleaner-control.c.
2011-10-28-11.55.47: For clarity and consistency renamed  src/c/cleaner/ -> src/c/heapcleaner/.
2011-10-28-11.33.35: For consistency and clarity renamed  src/c/lib/multicore -> src/c/lib/pthread  and  src/c/multicore to src/c/pthread.
2011-10-27-22.32.42: Renamed src/lib/std/src/multicore.api -> src/lib/std/src/posix-thread.api and  src/lib/std/src/multicore.pkg -> src/lib/std/src/posix-thread.pkg because in practice it will wind up being the Mythryl-level interface to posix thread functionality.
2011-10-27-22.03.49: src/lib/std/src/multicore.api: Expanded skeletal api per original Portable Multiprocessor Interface for SML/NJ paper.
2011-10-27-18.32.00: src/lib/std/standard.lib: Added api Multicore and pkg multicore to exports.  src/lib/std/src/multicore.pkg: Now looks up actual fns from src/c/lib/multicore/libmythryl-multicore.c. (Types are still bogus.)
2011-10-27-17.32.58: src/lib/std/standard.lib: Added api Multicore and pkg multicore to exports.  src/lib/std/src/multicore.pkg: Now looks up actual fns from src/c/lib/multicore/libmythryl-multicore.c. (Types are still bogus.)
2011-10-27-17.32.58: src/lib/std/src/: Did clone-and-edit to create placeholder multicore.api + multicore.pkg from existing ncurses.api + ncurses.pkg.
2011-10-27-12.51.30: src/c/lib/mythryl-callable-c-libraries-list.h: Commented out the #ifdef MULTICORE_SUPPORT around Libmythryl_Multicore to make it permanently a part of the system.
2011-10-27-12.29.42: src/c/o/Makefile.in: Added /multicore/libmythryl-multicore.a interface code to CLIBS so it would start getting compiled again (after 15 years! :-)
2011-10-27-12.11.34: src/c/o/Makefile.in: Commenting.
2011-10-26-22.12.08: Random commenting re multicore library stuff.
2011-10-26-22.12.08: src/c/o/Makefile.intel32-linux: commenting.  Tried pervasively changing mythryl-runtime-ia32 -> mythryl-runtime-intel32 but got no in-core heap image found from src/c/cleaner/import-heap.c which baffled me, so backed that out.  Another day.
2011-10-26-14.07.06: src/c/h/runtime-multicore.h:  Extensive analysis and commenting of the API for platform-specific multicore support.
2011-10-23-13.36.43: Test check-in.
2011-10-23-13.27.16: src/lib/src/gtk-unit-test.pkg, src/lib/src/gtk-via-pipe-unit-test.pkg: Dropped  tests suffix from name string because it is a nuisance.
2011-10-23-12.15.52: src/lib/src/gtk.api: Made Widget abstract again instead of exporting its Int implementation.  (Did the latter for debugging, forgot to clean up when done.)
2011-10-23-12.08.22: Tidying centering on src/lib/compiler/front/typer-stuff/types/types.api, in particular moving the YES/NO/... equality-type stuff into a new eq_type subpackage to improve namespace cleanliness.  src/lib/core/internal/mythryl-compiler-version.pkg: Bumped version from 6.0.0 -> 6.0.1 just to be distinct from the 6.0.0 release.  Fixed two doc typos pointed out by spiralofhope -- thanks!
2011-10-22-10.44.24: src/lib/std/src/list.api: Minor cleaning.
2011-10-15-02.45.49: src/lib/src/make-gtk-glue:  Fixed several places where the generated code was still expecting an Int arg, when the new arrangement is to pass it a (Session, Int) tuple.  Also, write_gtk_driver_c_set_callback_fun was using 'widget' where 'w0' was required.  src/lib/core/internal/mythryl-compiler-version.pkg: Advanced version from 5.3.0 -> 6.0.0 in celebration of the fact the codebase now builds and checks entirely without warnings. Yippee! :-)
2011-10-14-12.05.32: Additional commenting and cross-referencing in src/lib/src/gtk*pkg.
2011-10-13-03.11.04: Fixed: For some months 'make rest' had been failing to build src/lib/compiler/back/low/tools/arch/make-sourcecode-for-backend-packages.lib.frozen. Immediate cause was that the .lib file was incorrectly using SUBLIBRARY_EXPORTS / SUBLIBRARY_COMPONENTS instead of LIBRARY_EXPORTS / LIBRARY_COMPONENTS. Aggravating factor was that src/app/makelib/parse/libfile-parser-g.pkg was issuing no error message in this case, instead merely silently ignoring the freeze command.  Fixing this exposed some other files incorrectly using SUB* instead of LIB*, in particular sh/_build-an-executable-mythryl-heap-image and etc/mythryl-compiler-root.lib. All fixed.
2011-10-11-23.41.30: src/app/makelib/mythryl-compiler-compiler/mythryl-compiler-compiler-g.pkg, src/app/makelib/parse/libfile-parser-g.pkg: Added logging support.
2011-10-11-23.08.01: src/lib/std/src/io/file-g.pkg: Using previous, added logic to suppress multiple logfile headers.
2011-10-11-21.55.57: src/lib/std/src/io/file.api: Added exists: String -> Bool which returns TRUE iff given filepath can be 'stat'-ed successfully.
2011-10-11-12.42.11: src/lib/std/src/io/file.api: For consistency and brevity, renamed pure_io subpackage to pio.
2011-10-11-11.50.56: src/lib/std/src/io/file-g.pkg:  To keep multiple processes from stepping on each other's log output, changed logprint to use  open_for_append  rather than  open_for_write.
2011-10-11-11.24.03: src/app/makelib/freezefile/freezefile-g.pkg: Added logging support.
2011-10-11-10.29.37: src/lib/std/src/io/file-g.pkg: Tweaked the logfile blurb yet again.  src/app/makelib/main/makelib-g.pkg: Added logging support.

2011-10-11-00.05.24: src/lib/std/src/io/file-g.pkg: Update top-of-logfile blurb.
2011-10-10-14.11.36: src/lib/compiler/back/low/treecode/operand-table-g.pkg:  For sanity renamed opn -> operand throughout.  src/lib/compiler/back/low/code/machcode-universals.api (etc):  To make preceding work, renamed opn -> operand throughout.
2011-10-10-13.28.39: src/lib/compiler/back/low/treecode/operand-table-g.pkg:  For consistency and clarity renamed word -> unt as appropriate.
2011-10-10-13.12.40: src/lib/compiler/back/low/treecode/operand-table-g.pkg:  For consistency and clarity renamed int1 -> one_word_int throughout.  For sanity and the greater glory of Samuel Johnson renamed mk -> make throughout.
2011-10-10-13.04.31: src/lib/compiler/back/low/treecode/operand-table-g.pkg:  For clarity and consistency renamed word32 -> one_word_unt throughout.
2011-10-10-12.58.09: src/lib/compiler/back/low/treecode/operand-table-g.pkg: For clarity and consistency renamed *int_inf* -> *multiword_int* throughout.
2011-10-10-12.50.57: src/lib/compiler/back/low/treecode/operand-table-g.pkg:  Fixed some accumulated bitrot.
2011-10-10-12.36.32: src/lib/src/hashtable.api: Renamed lookup => look_up because 'lookup' is a noun and 'look up' is the corresponding verb.  Dammit.
2011-10-10-12.18.04: src/lib/src/hashtable.api: make_hashtable: For clarity and consistency changed second arg from   (Int, Exception)   to   { size_hint: Int, not_found_exception: Exception }.   src/lib/compiler/back/low/treecode/rtl-props.api:  Fixed some accumulated bitrot.
2011-10-10-11.16.13: src/lib/std/src/nj/export.api (etc):  To make code more self-documenting added   Fork_Result = AM_PARENT | AM_CHILD;  and changed   fork_to_disk   from   String -> Bool   to   String -> Fork_Result.

2011-10-10-10.32.33: Minor commenting in make-sourcecode-for-backend-* and src/lib/compiler/back/low/*/*.architecture-description.
2011-10-09-21.41.15: src/lib/src/make-gtk-glue:  write_gtk_driver_c_set_callback_fun:  Changed   "GtkWidget* w0 ="   ->   "GtkWidget* w0 __attribute__((unused)) ="   to suppress some unused-variable warnings.   Makefile:  Added cheg: target to exercise gtk-glue, in the hope of avoiding future bitrot accumulation in that subsystem.  After five years, the C layer *finally* compiles warning-free at -Wall! :-) :-) :-)
2011-10-09-14.23.20: src/lib/src/make-gtk-glue: Fix two bitrots, in particular CFUNC was supplying 3 instead of 4 args. (fn name duplicated to ease changes).
2011-10-09-13.46.09: Fixed bitrot due to my not doing 'make gtk-glue' regularly:  src/lib/src/gtk-g.pkg: Changed imp::set -> int_map::set.  src/lib/src/make-gtk-glue: Changed list_mergesort::sort -> list_mergesort::sort_list and eight_bye_float -> eight_byte_float.
2011-10-08-22.28.02: src/c/lib/posix-os/tmpname.c: Rewrote to not use tmpnam(), which might be a bit better and suppresses a warning.  Created src/c/lib/posix-file-system/mkstemp.c, recommended as a more secure alternative, accessible via src/lib/std/src/posix-1003.1b/posix-file.pkg: UNTESTED.
2011-10-08-20.26.48: src/c/cleaner/mem-writer.c: Suppressed three compile warnings.
2011-10-08-20.13.12: src/c/cleaner/import-heap-stuff.c:  Suppressed two warnings by addingd missing 'return SUCCESS' in heapio__seek and casting strlen arg from Unt8* to> char*.
2011-10-08-20.02.44: src/c/lib/socket/hexdump-if.c:  Fixed a "implicit declaration of function isprint" warning by including <ctype.h>.
2011-10-08-19.33.57: src/c/cleaner/datastructure-pickler-cleaner.c:  Suppressed "chunk_bytesize may be used uninitialized in this function" warning.
2011-10-08-19.28.26: src/c/lib/socket/get-or-set-boolean-socket-option.c:  Fixed "pointer targets in passing argument 5 of getsockopt differ in signedness" warning.
2011-10-08-19.15.16: src/c/cleaner/make-package-literals-via-bytecode-interpreter.c:  Suppressed "unused variable max_depth" warning.
2011-10-08-19.01.36: src/c/lib/socket/util-mkhostent.c: Suppressed four compiler warnings.
2011-10-08-18.39.14: src/c/cleaner/clean-n-agegroups.c:  Suppressed a "scan_memory_for_bogus_pointers declared static but never defined" compiler warning.
2011-10-08-18.28.36: src/c/cleaner/cleaner-initialization.c: Added proper #include files for write() and gettimeofday(); rewrote to pass arg of correct type to gettimeofday().
2011-10-08-17.55.17: For sanity, consistency, and the greater glory of Cthulhu:  Tweaked src/c/h/system-dependent-unix-stuff.h to no longer trigger "OS_NAME redefined" warnings;  tweaked src/c/h/architecture-and-os-names-system-dependent.h to generate OS_NAME values which are valid lower-case identifiers;  tweaked src/lib/std/src/nj/platform-properties.pkg to be consistent with the latter values.
2011-10-08-16.52.56: src/c/machine-dependent/posix-profiling-support.c: Changed  SET_SIGNAL_HANDLER( SIGVTALRM, SIG_DFL );  ->  SET_SIGNAL_HANDLER( SIGVTALRM, (void*)SIG_DFL )  to suppress a spurious "assignment from incompatible pointer type" warning.
2011-10-08-16.13.10: src/c/main/runtime-main.c: Conditionally included <unistd.h> to suppress implicit-declaration compiler warnings on functions 'close' and 'write'.
2011-10-08-02.01.57: src/lib/x-kit/widget/menu/popup-menu.pkg:  Suppressed nonexhaustive-match compiler warning.  That was the last one. :-)
2011-10-07-23.45.07: src/lib/compiler/back/low/tools/match-compiler/match-gen-g.pkg: Fixed nonexhaustive-match compiler warning (a real bug this time).
2011-10-07-22.45.30: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/pkg/window/keymap-imp.pkg:  Suppressed a nonexhaustive-match compiler warning.

2011-10-07-13.01.15: src/lib/compiler/back/low/tools/arch/make-sourcecode-for-translate-machcode-to-asmcode-xxx-g-package.pkg: Suppressed nonexhaustive-match compiler warnings.
2011-10-07-12.25.45: src/lib/compiler/back/low/tools/arch/adl-typing.pkg: Suppressed a nonexhaustive-match compiler warning.
2011-10-07-11.59.58: Try II: src/lib/compiler/back/low/tools/arch/architecture-description.pkg: Suppressed a nonexhaustive-match compiler warning.

2011-10-07-11.34.25: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/mailop.pkg: Suppressed a nonexhaustive-match compiler warning. 'make compiler' now compiles warning-free at the Mythryl level.
2011-10-07-11.17.52: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/thread-scheduler.pkg:  Suppressed a nonexhaustive-match compiler warning.

2011-10-06-22.59.25: src/lib/regex/backend/nfa.pkg:  Suppressed a nonexhaustive-match compiler warning.
2011-10-06-22.45.46: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/mailslot.pkg: Suppressed some nonexhaustive-match compiler warnings.
2011-10-06-22.20.44: src/lib/compiler/back/low/tools/arch/adl-type-junk.pkg: Suppressed some nonexhaustive-match compiler warnings.
2011-10-06-21.15.48: src/lib/compiler/back/low/tools/parser/architecture-description-language.grammar: Suppressed a couple of nonexhaustive-match compiler warnings.
2011-10-06-21.04.16: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/oneshot-maildrop.pkg: Tidying, suppressed a nonexhaustive-match compiler warning.
2011-10-06-15.56.25: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/threadkit-io-manager.pkg: Suppressed nonexhaustive-match compiler warning.
2011-10-06-15.56.25: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/maildrop.pkg: Suppressed a nonexhaustive-match compiler warning.
2011-10-06-15.40.42: src/lib/compiler/back/low/tools/adl-syntax/adl-raw-syntax-unparser.pkg: Suppressed two more nonexhaustive-match compiler warnings.
2011-10-06-14.48.12: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/mailqueue.pkg: Suppressed another nonexhaustive-match compiler warning.
2011-10-06-14.34.38: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/mailqueue.pkg: Tidying.
2011-10-06-13.20.35: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/mailqueue.pkg: Suppressed a nonexhaustive-match warning.
2011-10-06-13.09.53: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/thread-scheduler.pkg: Tidying.
2011-10-06-12.54.51: Try II: src/lib/std/src/: For clarity and consistency, renamed exceptions.api -> exceptions-guts.api, and internally renamed api Pre_Exceptions -> Exceptions_Guts.
2011-10-06-12.45.44: src/lib/std/src/: For clarity and consistency, renamed exceptions.api -> exceptions-guts.api, and internally renamed api Pre_Exceptions -> Exceptions_Guts.
2011-10-06-12.45.44: Established src/lib/std/exceptions.api, extracting its contents from the bottom of src/lib/std/src/exceptions.api.
2011-10-06-12.35.59: Renamed src/lib/std/src/exceptions.pkg -> src/lib/std/src/exceptions-guts.pkg for consistency and to distinguish it clearly from src/lib/std/exceptions.pkg.
2011-10-02-20.28.46: src/lib/: renamed controls/ -> global-controls/ and within it control* -> global-control*, as a first step toward eventually getting rid of them completely.  Every one of these is a global variable, and every global variable is a roadblock on the way to concurrent programming in Mythryl.
2011-10-02-14.11.38: src/lib/compiler/toplevel/main/: Renamed controls.api -> global-controls.api, controls.pkg -> global-controls.pkg, partly for clarity, partly to free up those names for an eventual local-controls (i.e., pure-functional red-black-tree-based) package.
2011-10-01-06.24.47: Minor tidying.
2011-10-01-06.01.04: src/lib/core/internal/mythryl-compiler-version.pkg: Advanced version to 5.3.0 because Parallel Compiles (Take Two) seems to be working.
2011-10-01-03.25.04: src/lib/std/src/posix/spawn.api: Added support for (REDIRECT_STDERR_TO_STDOUT_IN_CHILD  Bool) option to spawn_process{} and fork_process{}.
2011-10-01-02.56.21: src/lib/std/src/posix/spawn.api: Thoroughly reworked this API along the lines suggested by Joe Wells.
2011-09-30-13.40.36: For clarity:  src/lib/std/src/posix-1003.1b/posix-file.api: Renamed make_pipe -> make_named_pipe. src/lib/std/src/posix-1003.1b/posix-io.api: Renamed pipe -> make_pipe.
2011-09-30-03.38.47: Dropped the old remote-compile stuff because 1) It never worked; 2) I cannot forsee much if any practical use for it. 3) It complicates the code. 4) The new fork()-ing based parallel compilation mechanism is simpler and much more useful in practice.  This involved removing:  src/app/makelib/concurrency/dummy-makelib-client.pkg, src/app/makelib/concurrency/makelib-client-queen.api, src/app/makelib/concurrency/makelib-client-queen.pkg, src/app/makelib/main/makelib-server.pkg and all refernces to them.  Yay!!
2011-09-29-22.33.05: src/lib/std/src/posix/spawn.api: From common decency renamed txt_instream_of -> get_text_input_stream_from etc.  Every time you mutilate a word, God kills a kitten.  Think of the kittens.
2011-09-29-19.41.12: src/app/makelib/compile/compile-in-dependency-order-g.pkg: Parallel compiles working. src/lib/core/internal/mythryl-compiler-version.pkg: Advanced to 5.2.0 in honor of previous.
2011-09-29-04.01.40: src/lib/std/src/posix/spawn.api: To simplify the api and close a race-condition window, changed process_id_of type from  Process(X,Y) -> Null_Or(Int)  to   Process(X,Y) -> Int.   src/lib/std/src/posix/spawn.pkg: To implement previous, changed Process_Status to remember the process_id of DEAD processes.
2011-09-29-03.26.31: src/lib/std/src/posix/spawn.api: For clarity, renamed pid_of -> process_id_of. Clarify globally, abbreviate locally.
2011-09-28-03.41.11: src/c/lib/posix-os/poll.c: This was segfaulting due to basically doing  if (ptr==NULL) foo=*ptr. Fixed. This was my fault; the ancestral SML/NJ 110.58 was correct.
2011-09-27-21.46.01: src/c/lib/socket/: Added to-log.c to give Mythryl-level access to log-if.c
2011-09-27-12.55.22: Add a paragraph to src/A.LOGGER.OVERVIEW.
2011-09-27-00.42.12: Bumped version number to 5.1.0 in honor of previous check-in.
2011-09-26-23.11.45: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/logger.pkg: Rationalized and coordinated C-level, monothread-mythryl and multithread-mythryl logging by moving much of the guts of logger.pkg into src/lib/std/src/io/file-g.pkg, making the calls at all three levels more alike and adding logging of pid to the line format.
2011-09-26-03.37.27: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/logger.pkg: Tidying.
2011-09-26-01.10.22: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/: For clarity renamed tracing.api -> logger.api, tracing.pkg -> logger.pkg.  src/lib/x-kit/xclient/pkg/stuff/: For clarity and consistency renamed xtracing.pkg -> xlogger.pkg
2011-09-25-02.03.37: src/lib/std/src/posix/spawn.api: Added pid_of call.
2011-09-24-16.59.03: src/app/makelib/compile/compile-in-dependency-order-g.pkg: Located and marked proper spot to fork() off compile subprocesses.
2011-09-24-13.03.57: src/app/makelib/concurrency/makelib-thread-queen.pkg: Added cores_in_use and core_wait_queue to Makelib_Thread_Queen state record, as a first step toward supporting multicore compiles via fork().
2011-09-24-12.24.19: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/winix/threadkit-winix-io.api: For clarity and consistency, renamed 'poll' -> 'wait_for_io_opportunity' and 'poll_mailop' -> 'wait_for_io_opportunity_mailop'. Pervasively: Added 'select' as a deprecated synonym for 'wait_for_io_opportunity', so that unix folks looking for 'select' in the function index will get led to the right spots.
2011-09-24-12.00.21: Lots of stuff. src/lib/std/src/winix/winix-io.api: Renamed poll_io_descriptors -> wait_for_io_opportunity (etc) because the whole point is that it does not poll, it blocks. src/app/makelib/concurrency/makelib-thread.pkg: Eliminated global variables by introducing a Makelib_Thread_Queen state record; renamed package to makelib-thread-queen.pkg.  Similarly eliminated global variables from makelib-client.pkg and renamed to makelib-client-queen.pkg.
2011-09-23-22.54.43: src/app/makelib/concurrency/: Renamed makelib-thread.pkg -> makelib-thread-boss.pkg as first step to elimating the package's global variables.
2011-09-23-14.40.43: src/lib/std/src/posix/spawn.pkg: Factored fork_process' out of spawn_process_in_environment, then added a new fork_process call (which I need for compile-in-dependency-order-g.pkg work.)
2011-09-23-02.59.17: src/lib/std/src/unix/spawn.api: Reversing edit of 2010-09-11-11.29.22, renamed process -> spawn_process and process_in_environment -> spawn_process_in_environment because I've standardized on not considering the package name part of a function name (package might get renamed at point of use -- by current programming protocol, will always be renamed at point of use).
2011-09-22-19.17.26: src/app/makelib/compile/compile-in-dependency-order-g.pkg: Tidying.
2011-09-21-14.36.41: src/app/makelib/concurrency/makelib-thread.pkg: Replaced make_unix_pipe_input_wait_queue with new read_line_from_unix_pipe fn -- this is a more natural unit of functionality which streamlines the client-end code.
2011-09-21-14.07.30: src/app/makelib/concurrency/makelib-thread.pkg: For clarity, renamed spawn_stream_proxy_thread -> make_unix_pipe_input_wait_queue.
2011-09-21-13.52.37: src/app/makelib/main/: For clarity and accuracy, renamed compile-server.pkg -> makelib-server.pkg.  src/app/makelib/concurrency/: Similarly renamed compile-client.api -> makelib-client.api, renamed compile-client.pkg -> makelib-client.pkg, dummy-compile-client.pkg -> dummy-makelib-client.pkg.
2011-09-21-11.35.33: app/makelib/simple-concurrency/: Renamed simple-concurrency.sublib -> makelib-concurrency.sublib for consistency with previous.
2011-09-21-11.25.51: app/makelib/simple-concurrency/: Renamed simple-thread.pkg -> makelib-thread.pkg because it is a dedicated package neither intended nor suitable for use outside of makelib.
2011-09-21-05.13.02: src/app/makelib/simple-concurrency/compile-client.pkg: Random cleaning.
2011-09-21-04.51.00: src/lib/std/src/winix/winix-io.api: For clarity, renamed poll(poll_requests,timeout) -> poll_io_descriptors { poll_requests, timeout }.
2011-09-20-22.32.24: src/app/makelib/compile/compile-in-dependency-order-g.pkg: Tidying.
2011-09-18-23.44.06: For clarity pervasively renamed filesys -> file-system.
2011-09-18-23.17.06: For clarity, renamed src/c/lib/posix-procenv -> src/c/lib/posix-process-environment.
2011-09-18-23.05.47: src/app/makelib/compile/compile-in-dependency-order-g.pkg: Cleaning, commenting and clarifying.
2011-09-18-15.37.15: Renamed graphwalk to dagwalk everywhere for accuracy and brevity, and because it is more euphonious.
2011-09-18-14.37.32: src/lib/core/internal/mythryl-compiler-version.pkg: Belatedly bumped version to 5.0.1 in honor of answer_42's bugfix.
2011-09-18-12.50.31: sh/_guess-host-architecture-and-os: Backpatched answer_42's (via Michele Bini) "3.0.*) ;;" fix for x86 Linux kernel 3.0.x support.
2011-09-18-01.19.50: src/lib/std/src/list.api:  Added new map' and apply' (reverse arg order from map and apply) from src/lib/core/init/pervasive.pkg.
2011-09-18-01.10.22: src/lib/std/src/list.api: For clarity renamed map' -> map_partial_fn.  src/lib/core/init/pervasive.pkg: Added map' x f = map f x, apply' x f = apply f x.
2011-09-17-13.41.33: 5.0.0 release.
2011-09-17-04.08.10: src/app/benchmarks/:  Added tagged-int-shellsort-no-bounds-checking.pkg -- more than twice as fast as tagged-int-shellsort.pkg.
2011-09-17-03.56.22: src/app/benchmarks/tagged-int-shellsort.pkg: Implemented.
2011-09-17-03.29.01: src/app/benchmarks/: Established dummy tagged-int-shellsort.pkg benchmark.
2011-09-17-03.11.42: src/lib/compiler/back/top/translate/translate-deep-syntax-to-lambdacode.pkg: Implemented compiler::check_vector_index_bounds control.
2011-09-17-02.35.06: src/lib/compiler/toplevel/main/compiler-controls.pkg:  Added compiler::check_vector_index_bounds control. (Does nothing yet.)
2011-09-17-00.08.37: src/lib/compiler/toplevel/main/: Renamed backend-controls.pkg -> compiler-controls.pkg and thus backend::trap_int_overflow -> compiler::trap_int_overflow (etc), to be less confusing the the application programmer.
2011-09-16-02.36.52: src/lib/compiler/toplevel/main/backend-controls.pkg: trap_int_overflow now defaults to FALSE.
2011-09-16-00.36.25: src/lib/compiler/back/low/main/main/translate-nextcode-to-treecode-g.pkg: Tweaked to generate overflow-trapping ops (*_OR_TRAP) only if  *bec::trap_int_overflow  is  TRUE.
2011-09-15-23.56.25: src/lib/compiler/back/low/treecode/treecode-form.api:  For clarity, renamed NEGT -> NEG_OR_TRAP, ADDT -> ADD_OR_TRAP, SUBT -> SUB_OR_TRAP, MULT -> MULS_OR_TRAP, DIVT -> DIVS_OR_TRAP. (These are the arithmetic-overflow-trapping versions of NEG/ADD/SUB/MULS/DIVS respectively.  There is no REM_OR_TRAP because the remainder op never overflows.)
2011-09-15-23.43.41: src/lib/compiler/toplevel/main/backend-controls.pkg: Did a clone-and-hack with insufficient hack and backend::trap_int_overflow wound up named "verbose_compile_log", oops. Fixed.
2011-09-15-21.58.24: In all files using OVERFLOW, added the line   #DO set_control "backend::trap_int_overflow" "TRUE";
2011-09-15-15.05.34: src/lib/compiler/toplevel/main/backend-controls.pkg: Added   backend::trap_int_overflow   control. (Does nothing as yet.)
2011-09-15-13.21.21: src/lib/compiler/toplevel/main/backend-controls.pkg: Added backend::verbose_compile_log control; now to get verbose compile logs you can just put '#DO set_control "backend::verbose_compile_log" "TRUE";' at the top of the file, instead of having to edit fun do_verbose_logging_for in src/app/makelib/compile/compile-in-dependency-order-g.pkg and recompile the compiler.
2011-09-15-13.01.35: #DO code evaluation no longer echoed to stdout -- was cluttering the compiler console narration.
2011-09-15-02.09.35: Benchmark code tweaking.
2011-09-14-19.34.12: src/app/benchmarks/:  Did a clone-and-mutate on   tagged-int-loop.pkg  to produce a second benchmark,  src/app/benchmarks/one-word-int-loop.pkg.
2011-09-14-19.16.02: src/lib/std/src/cpu-timer.api:  For clarity, changed gc -> heapcleaner and nongc -> program throughout.
2011-09-14-18.34.12: src/lib/std/src/cpu-timer.api: Renamed everything for clarity, changed value types from time::Time to Float for convenience.
2011-09-14-15.29.31: src/lib/std/src/time.api: For clarity and to proactively reduce the probability of obscure bugs, renamed  to_float -> to_float_seconds  and  from_float -> from_float_seconds.
2011-09-14-14.40.44: Added src/app/benchmarks/tagged-int-loop.pkg benchmark, got it to compile and run.
2011-09-14-14.12.39: src/lib/std/src/cpu-timer.api: Added Cpu_Times type as a convenience for client packages.
2011-09-14-12.41.07: Zeroth-order   "make benchmarks"   framework compiles and runs.
2011-09-14-12.32.51: Renamed  src/app/benchmark/ -> src/app/benchmarks/  because I keep typing it in that way anyhow.
2011-09-14-12.15.36: Cloned  "make check"  to produce a zeroth-order  "make benchmarks".
2011-09-14-00.36.21: Downloaded a 1996 Xavier Leroy smlnj benchmark set and saved it in new directory src/app/benchmark/ for eventual translation into Mythryl.
2011-09-14-00.15.52: Try 2: src/lib/controls/control-forms.pkg: Renamed  Priority -> Menu_Rank (etc) because that is what it in fact is.  src/lib/src/list-mergesort.pkg: For clarity renamed sort -> sort_list, sorted -> list_is_sorted, unique_sort -> sort_list_and_drop_duplicates.
2011-09-14-00.07.24: src/lib/controls/control-forms.pkg: Renamed  Priority -> Menu_Rank (etc) because that is what it in fact is.  src/lib/src/list-mergesort.pkg: For clarity renamed sort -> sort_list, sorted -> list_is_sorted, unique_sort -> sort_list_and_drop_duplicates.
2011-09-14-00.07.24: src/lib/controls/control-forms.pkg: Renamed  Priority -> Menu_Rank (etc) because that is what it in fact is.  src/lib/src/list-mergesort.pkg: For clarity renamed sort -> sort_list, sorted -> list_is_sorted, unique_sort -> sort_list_and_drop_duplicates.
2011-09-13-21.23.33: src/lib/controls/: Renamed  control-reps.pkg -> control-forms.pkg because every time we mutilate a word, God kills a kitten.  Think of the kittens.
2011-09-13-20.48.49: src/lib/compiler/toplevel/main/: Renamed  backend-lowhalf-controls.pkg -> backend-controls.pkg  because they are used throughout the backend.
2011-09-13-12.09.40: sh/make-install: patch -p1 in DESTDIR support. Thanks to Michele Bini for contributing this, not to mention Debianizing the whole Mythryl distribution!
2011-09-13-01.24.43: #DO now working to a first approximation.
2011-09-11-17.35.33: Random tidying, mostly changing instances of Sourcecode_Info to be named sourcecode_info.
2011-09-11-14.04.38: src/lib/compiler/front/parser/raw-syntax/raw-syntax.pkg:  Added PRE_COMPILE_CODE(String) to Declaration.
2011-09-11-13.05.06: Zeroth-order src/lib/compiler/front/parser/lex/mythryl.lex pre_compile_code support:  #DO foo bar<eol>  functions as a comment.
2011-09-11-02.19.13: Much cleaning centering on src/lib/compiler/front/basics/stats/compile-statistics.pkg; Added new tokens PRE_COMPILE_CODE and POSTCOMPILE_CODE in src/lib/compiler/front/parser/yacc/mythryl.grammar.
2011-09-10-03.00.11: Moved memoize.pkg from src/app/makelib/stuff/ to src/lib/std/ because it is generally useful, not compiler-specific.
2011-09-10-02.03.50: src/lib/compiler/front/basics/print/: Renamed printcontrol.pkg -> control-print.pkg because in fact it contained package control_print and api Control_Print.
2011-09-08-05.34.53: src/lib/compiler/front/basics/source/: Renamed source-code-source -> sourcecode-info.pkg for clarity, much random cleaning.
2011-09-08-05.34.53: Document Michele Binis .deb archive (! :-) for Mythryl.
2011-09-08-05.34.53: Development moved from Debian 5 (lenny) to Debian 6 (squeeze).
2011-09-08-05.20.41: Test III
2011-09-08-05.10.10: Test II
2011-09-08-03.09.46: test
2011-09-06-04.12.17: test
2011-09-06-04.12.17: 4.2.0 release: More renaming of number and vector packages.
2011-09-03-07.04.37: Random tidying centering on src/lib/core/init/built-in.pkg.
2011-09-03-05.11.18: Pervasively renamed intinf -> integer for clarity and because it has indefinite precision, never infinite precision.
2011-09-03-04.49.03: Pervasively renamed int64 -> int2 (2-word int) so as to be agnostic between 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. (Int2 will be 64 bits on 32-bit architectures, 128 bits on 64-bit architectures.)
2011-09-03-04.28.53: Pervasively renamed unt64 -> unt2 (2-word unt) so as to be agnostic between 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. (Unt2 will be 64 bits on 32-bit architectures, 128 bits on 64-bit architectures.)
2011-09-03-03.55.52: Pervasively renamed unt32 -> unt1 (1-word unt) so as to be agnostic between 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. (Unt1 will be 32 bits on 32-bit architectures, 64 bits on 64-bit architectures.)
2011-09-03-02.48.57: Pervasively renamed int32 -> int1 (1-word int) so as to be agnostic between 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. (Int1 will be 32 bits on 32-bit architectures, 64 bits on 64-bit architectures.)
2011-09-03-01.46.18: Pervasively renamed int31 -> tagged_int so as to be agnostic between 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. (Tagged ints will be 63 bits long on 64-bit architectures.)
2011-09-01-13.02.00: Switching on pass-runtime reporting via show_compile_phase_runtimes_for make-nextcode-closures-g.pkg in src/app/makelib/compile/compile-dependency-graph-walk-g.pkg appeared to trigger a heap-corruption Heisenbug...? Gone for the moment.
2011-08-29-22.26.43: Standardized on 'err' (vs 'em') as abbreviation for package error_message.
2011-08-29-16.58.23: Cleaning and commenting centered on  src/lib/compiler/toplevel/interact/compiler-state.pkg
2011-08-29-13.58.42: More cleaning and commenting centering on src/app/makelib/compile/compile-dependency-graph-walk-g.pkg

2011-08-28-14.01.57: For clarity, renamed compile-treewalk-g.pkg -> compile-dependency-graph-walk-g.pkg, linking-treewalk-g.pkg -> linking-dependency-graph-walk-g.pkg.
2011-08-28-13.28.28: Cosmetics like changing  Foo( X )  ->  Foo(X)  for better readability.
2011-08-25-03.47.36: Much commenting, renaming and clarifying centering on src/lib/compiler/back/top/nextcode/nextcode-form.api, which is now largely decoded.
2011-08-22-01.32.36: src/lib/compiler/back/top/nextcode/nextcode-form.api: For clarity, renamed 'codetemp' fields to 'to_temp'.
2011-08-21-15.06.41: src/lib/compiler/back/top/closures/make-nextcode-closures-g.pkg: Changed CLOSURE_REP from tuple to record.
2011-08-21-13.15.45: Random commenting centering on src/lib/compiler/back/low/main/main/translate-nextcode-to-treecode-g.pkg
2011-08-19-04.57.16: src/lib/compiler/back/top/nextcode/nextcode-form.api: For clarity, pervasively renamed name -> codetemp.
2011-08-18-17.24.10: More fatecode -> nextcode renaming stuff.
2011-08-18-13.47.23: Try 2: Pervasively renamed fatecode -> nextcode because foo.next is clearer than foo.fate.
2011-08-10-05.12.18: Pervasively renamed fatecode -> nextcode because foo.next is clearer than foo.fate.
2011-08-14-02.09.01: Random commenting and cleaning centering on   src/lib/compiler/back/low/main/main/translate-fatecode-to-treecode-g.pkg. Pervasively renamed codestream -> codebuffer.
2011-08-13-00.33.43: src/lib/compiler/back/low/main/fatecode/emit-treecode-heapcleaner-calls-g.pkg: Decoding and commenting basically complete.
2011-08-10-05.11.51: src/lib/compiler/back/low/main/fatecode/: For clarity renamed insert-treecode-heapcleaner-calls.api -> emit-treecode-heapcleaner-calls.api, insert-treecode-heapcleaner-calls-g.pkg -> emit-treecode-heapcleaner-calls-g.pkg; Much commenting in latter.
2011-08-10-05.12.18: src/lib/compiler/back/low/main/fatecode/: For clarity renamed insert-treecode-heapcleaner-calls.api -> emit-treecode-heapcleaner-calls.api, insert-treecode-heapcleaner-calls-g.pkg -> emit-treecode-heapcleaner-calls-g.pkg; Much commenting in latter.
2011-08-08-13.39.22: Pervasively renamed all_callers_known -> private.  Appels known/escape/cont fn trichotomy terminology is terrible; private/public/fate seems the best replacement.
2011-08-07-23.46.40: src/lib/compiler/back/low/main/fatecode/insert-treecode-heapcleaner-calls-g.pkg: Improved typesafety by splitting Heapcleaner_Call into Heapcleaner_Call + Longjump_To_Heapcleaner_Call.
2011-08-07-16.11.08: src/lib/compiler/back/low/main/fatecode/insert-treecode-heapcleaner-calls-g.pkg: Random cleaning and commenting.

2011-08-06-00.33.24: Random cleaning and commenting.  src/lib/std/src/io/file.api: Change attribution from Jeffrey Lau to Michele Bini per post from former.
2011-08-04-02.02.50: 4.0.0 release, try 3.
2011-08-04-02.02.50: 4.0.0 release, try 2.
2011-08-04-00.23.13: 4.0.0 release.
2011-07-23-02.40.36: First clean build of release-4 docs. :-)
2011-07-19-20.25.02: Renamed generic_socket -> plain_socket etc to avoid confusion with technical meaning of generic -- and because briefer is better when clarity holds constant! :-)
2011-07-12-02.16.51: Got time-profiling working again! :-)  Documented in src/A.TRACE-DEBUG-PROFILE.OVERVIEW. Biggest glitch was that I had renamed subscript -> get in core.pkg but not add-per-fun-call-counters-to-deep-syntax.pkg.
2011-07-04-14.18.38: For clarity, renamed abscode (abstract machine code) -> machcode (abstract machine code :-)
2011-07-03-03.45.41: src/lib/src/typelocked-hashtable.api: For clarity, changed from  make_hashtable (32, FOO)  ->  make_hashtable { size_hint => 32, not_found_exception => FOO }.  (Ye godz there are a lot of hashtables in the codebase!)
2011-06-28-00.40.16: For clarity and consistency (and England and St George!) renamed src/lib/src/union-find.pkg -> src/lib/src/disjoint-sets-with-constant-time-union.pkg
2011-06-21-00.48.03: Renamed bitmatrix{api,pkg} -> graph-by-edge-hashtable{api,pkg}, because that is what it turned out to be, on closer inspection.
2011-06-20-21.39.00: For clarity and consistency, renamed make_table -> make_hashtable in all hashtable implementations.
2011-06-20-21.22.29: For consistency, conciseness and clarity, globally renamed hash_table -> hashtable, hash-table -> hashtable etc.
2011-06-20-20.35.01: Renamed src/lib/compiler/back/low/regor/regor-bitmatrix.{api,pkg} -> src/lib/std/src/bitmatrix.{api,pkg} because there is nothing remotely compiler-specific about it -- it is just a bitmatrix implementation.
2011-06-20-15.12.45: priority-queue.api: For consistency and clarity, renamed create -> make_priority_queue and create_n to make_priority_queue'.
2011-06-13-18.14.55: For conciseness and consistency, renamed src/lib/graph/oop-directed-graph.api -> src/lib/graph/oop-digraph.api.
2011-06-13-18.14.55: For clarity, conciseness, consistency and futureproofing, renamed src/lib/graph/directed-graph.pkg -> src/lib/graph/digraph-by-adjacency-list.pkg,  src/lib/graph/directed-graph-g.pkg -> src/lib/graph/digraph-by-adjacency-list-g.pkg.
2011-06-12-00.34.29: Renamed src/lib/graph/isograph.pkg -> mapped-digraph-view.pkg
2011-06-12-00.17.54: Moved src/lib/compiler/back/low/library/bitset.pkg src/lib/graph/bit-set.pkg, src/lib/compiler/back/low/library/bitset.api src/lib/graph/bit-set.api because they are used by other src/lib/graph/* packages.
2011-06-12-00.17.54: For clarity, renamed src/lib/graph/graph.api -> src/lib/graph/oop-directed-graph.api, src/lib/graph/graph.pkg -> src/lib/graph/oop-directed-graph.pkg
2011-06-09-02.03.20: Similarly pervasively replaced "polymorphic" with "typeagnostic".
2011-06-09-00.06.47: Finally lost it and globally renamed "monomorphic" to "typelocked". "Monomorphic" is a hideous polysyllabic academic obscurantism whose relevant meaning remains a mystery even when translated from Greek into Latin ("uniform") or English ("one-shaped").
2010-11-20-00.06.42: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-gtk/gtk-driver.c: _lib7_Gtk_gtk_init: Fixed: argc was being used uninitialized, which was segfaulting us. *BLUSH*!!
2010-11-16-13.53.28: Finished codepass converting /* ... */ -> // ... in (most) of the C code.
2010-11-16-02.49.10: More hours of changing /* ... */ -> // ... in the C code...
2010-11-15-23.09.58: src/runtime/heapcleaner/: import-heap.c export-heap.c:  More gcc -Wall driven tweaks.
2010-11-15-22.28.15: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/: recvbuffrom.c, recvfrom.c:  Two more gcc -Wall inspired fixes.
2010-11-15-21.44.57: src/runtime/heapcleaner/clean-full-heap.c:  clean_n_heap_generations: gcc -Wall warns promote_state may be used uninitialized.  Initialized it arbitrarily. There may be an actual bug here.
2010-11-15-20.47.20: src/runtime/heapcleaner/: clean-subheap.c, clean-full-heap.c:  Suppressed more harmless gcc -Wall warnings.
2010-11-15-20.33.11: src/runtime/c-libs/posix-io/lseek_64.c:  Suppressed another harmless gcc -Wall warning.
2010-11-15-20.10.46: src/runtime/c-libs/posix-io/fcntl_l_64.c: Suppressed three more harmless gcc -Wall warnings.
2010-11-15-19.05.47: src/runtime/c-libs/posix-filesys/stat_64.c: Fixed a (harmless) gcc -Wall warning.
2010-11-15-15.54.09: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-opencv/cvLoadImage.c: gcc -Wall caught me confusing 'image' (a Mythryl-heap val) with 'ipl_image' (a C-heap val). *blush*!  Fixed.
2010-11-15-15.31.25: Another four hours or so of converting C /* ... */ comments to // comments, with incidental passing-through tidying.
2010-11-15-02.06.09: gcc -Wall complained that ctlLINGER.c ctlNODELAY.c ctlRCVBUF.c exit.c ctlSNDBUF.c getERROR.c getTYPE.c getpeername.c getsockname.c accept.c were using an int where a socklen_t was required.  Fixed.
2010-11-14-19.34.16: Changed c89 /* ... */ comments to c99 // comments many places in the C code.
2010-11-13-22.15.36: Added -std=c99 -Wall to CFLAGS everywhere.  Because Its Time, as the BITNET folks used to say...
2010-11-11-11.36.28: src/runtime/include/: Renamed virtual-processor-state.h -> pthread.h.
2010-11-10-16.12.01: src/runtime/heapcleaner/: For clarity and consistency, renamed call-gc. -> call-heapcleaner.c, init-gc.c -> heapcleaner-initialization.c.
2010-11-10-15.29.40: For clarity, renamed src/runtime/gc/ -> src/runtime/heapcleaner.
2010-11-10-15.07.42: In the C runtimes, for consistency and clarity, pervasively renamed lib7_state_t -> Task and lib7_state -> task.
2010-11-10-14.29.56: src/runtime/include/runtime-base.h: For clarity and consistency, renamed Word_t -> Val_Sized_Unt (etc).  src/lib/std/src/nj/: For clarity, renamed signals.api -> runtime-signals.api (etc).
2010-11-10-12.52.34: Much cleaning in and around the C garbage collector, including favoring heapcleaner for a name for conciseness and renaming lib7_val_t to Val to reduce clutter.
2010-11-09-22.24.21: src/runtime/include/: Renamed vproc-state.h -> virtual-processor-state.h, and dropped vp_ prefix from field names.
2010-11-09-20.44.18: src/runtime/include/runtime-state.h: struct lib7_state: Eliminated lib7_ prefixes on fieldnames -- fieldname prefixes have not been needed in C since the BDS C days.
2010-11-09-14.37.08: For clarity, renamed src/runtime/include/runtime-mp.h -> src/runtime/include/runtime-multicore.h  and  src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-mp/liblib7-mp.c src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-multicore/liblib7-multicore.c
2010-11-09-14.18.59: src/runtime/: For clarity, renamed mp/ -> multicore/.
2010-11-09-13.12.13: src/runtime: For clarity, pervasively renamed MP_SUPPORT -> MULTICORE_SUPPORT etc. (Why cannot people just say what they mean? :-)
2010-11-07-14.07.45: For clarity, pervasively replaced assembly::foo with runtime::foo. (Very little of the runtime is in assembly.)
2010-11-06-01.45.05: For clarity, pervasively renamed p_struct and pstruct to pervasive_package_pickle_list.
2010-11-05-22.49.06: src/lib/core/internal/: Merged make-mythryl-compiler-etc-g.pkg into make-mythryl-compiler-etc.pkg:  The package no longer needs to be generic.
2010-11-04-23.05.28: src/lib/core/internal/make-mythryl-compiler-etc-g.pkg: make_mythryl_compiler_etc: To reduce code clutter, dropped support for --runtime-heap, making it instead a constant mythryld_executable_filename_to_create (== mythryld) in app/makelib/mythryl-compiler-compiler/mythryl-compiler-compiler-configuration.pkg.
2010-11-04-21.39.16: src/lib/compiler/backend/lower-half/tools/nowhere/: For clarity, renamed build -> build-nowhere-app.
2010-11-03-23.33.26: src/etc/: For clarity, renamed root.lib -> mythryl-compiler-root.lib.
2010-11-03-20.34.22: For typesafety, pervasively replaced (architecture_name: String) with (machine_architecture: sma::Supported_Machine_Architectures).
2010-11-03-12.46.03: Created src/lib/compiler/frontend/basics/main/supported-machine-architectures.pkg to provide typesafe machine architecture identification. (SML/NJ just uses strings -- bleah!)
2010-11-03-11.53.48: src/lib/core/internal/make-mythryl-compiler-etc-g.pkg: Dropped now-unneeded make_compiler generic arg.
2010-11-03-11.27.26: src/lib/core/internal/make-mythryl-compiler-etc-g.pkg: To reduce code clutter, dropped support for unused switches --runtime-bare, --runtime-rebuild, --runtime-lightrebuild.
2010-11-02-12.27.48: src/app/burg/: For clarity, renamed mythryl-burg -> mythryl-burg-fraser-hanson-proebsting-92-optimal-tree-rewriter.pkg (etc).  src/lib/core/internal/: For better factoring, created mythryld.pkg + mythryld.api
2010-11-01-15.23.25: src/lib/core/internal/: For clarity and conciseness, renamed build-mythryld-heap-image.pkg -> make-mythryld-executable.pkg.  Also renamed src/app/makelib/mythryl-compiler-compiler/A_COMPILE_COMPILER.OVERVIEW -> src/A.MAKE_COMPILER.INTERNALS.OVERVIEW.
2010-11-01-14.43.06: For consistency, renamed foo.pkg -> foo-g.pkg for a wearisome number of foo.  src/app/makelib/semant/: For clarity, renamed version.pkg -> makelib-version.pkg
2010-11-01-02.41.30: For consistency, renamed ia32*lib -> x86*lib.
2010-11-01-02.31.22: For clarity, pervasively renamed source-map -> line-number-db.
2010-10-31-17.42.56: Converted left-over o7/O7 references to dotcompiled/Dotcompiled.
2010-10-31-14.45.52: doc/tex/sh/: Tweaked make-comments and synthesize-sourcecode-latex-docs to (maybe) support .sublib as well as .lib files. (Untested.)
2010-10-31-11.59.16: For clarity, changed from real vs virtual library terminlogy to main- vs sub-library terminology. The former is mysterious, the latter is self-explanatory.
2010-10-30-20.17.02: For clarity, pervasively renamed sublibraries from foo.lib -> foo.sublib, where a sublibrary is defined to be one containing SUBLIBRARY_EXPORTS (vs LIBRARY_EXPORTS).
2010-10-30-16.44.03: For consistency, downcased all .lib filenames: Foo.lib -> foo.lib etc. I had been experimenting with mixed-case library names to make them stand out in a directory listing, but have decided that it is too un-unixy.
2010-10-30-15.58.00: In .lib files, for clarity and conciseness, changed LIBRARY_GROUP_EXPORTS -> SUBLIBRARY_EXPORTS and LIBRARY_GROUP_COMPONENTS -> SUBLIBRARY_COMPONENTS. Also added support for .sublib file extension.
2010-10-30-01.06.53: Renamed */Makefile.lib -> */foo.lib for various values of foo; the unix makefile analogy was counterproductive.
2010-10-29-22.46.16: For conciseness and consistency, renamed foo-lib.lib -> foo.lib for various values of foo.
2010-10-29-13.11.40: Changed from .make6 to .lib filename extensions because the analogy with unix makefiles ultimately does more harm than good: The primary significance of these files to the application programmer is that they define and represent libraries, not that they are re/built using a make-like dependency algorithm.
2010-10-24-18.30.45: For clarity, pervasively renamed make7 -> makelib.
2010-10-24-16.59.23: For clarity, in backend generic packages pervasively renamed asm -> asm_emitter.
2010-10-23-16.38.17: src/app/make7/mythryl-compiler-compiler/: Since .o7 files no longer exist, renamed find-set-of-o7-files-for-executable.pkg -> find-set-of-dotcompiled-files-for-executable.pkg.
2010-10-23-15.51.38: src/app/make7/freezefile/: Since .o7 files no longer exist, renamed iced-o7* -> frozen-compilable*.

2010-10-23-14.39.57: Since .o7 files no longer exist, renamed src/app/make7/o7 -> src/app/make7/compilable, src/lib/compiler/execution/o7-file -> src/lib/compiler/execution/dotcompiled-file.
2010-10-22-16.46.15: For clarity, switched from .o7 to .compiled for filenames for compiled files, e.g. foo.pkg.compiled instead of foo.pkg.o7, foo.api.compiled instead of foo.api.o7.
2010-10-22-01.38.38: src/lib/core/: Renamed make-compiler/ -> mythryl-compiler-compiler, MUCH related renaming.
2010-10-20-16.17.23: src/lib/core/internal/: Renamed boot-dictionary.pkg -> src/lib/core/internal/make-compiler-etc.pkg (etc) because it mainly wraps src/app/make7/make-compiler/make-compiler-g.pkg.
2010-10-20-13.52.14: src/lib/core/internal/: Renamed main.pkg -> build-mythryld-heap-image.pkg.
2010-10-20-12.02.57: src/app/make7/semant/: Renamed make7-grammar-actions.pkg -> make6file-grammar-actions.pkg.
2010-10-20-11.51.31: src/app/make7/parse/: Renamed make7.grammar -> make6file.grammar, make7.lex -> make6file.lex, because they in fact describe .make6 files.
2010-10-19-01.47.21: More s/unix/posix/ and s/unix// stuff in the name of clarity, consistency and precision.
2010-10-18-15.38.55: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/: For consistency and clarity, renamed to-unixaddr.c -> to-unix-domain-socket-address.c (etc).
2010-10-18-15.08.14: src/runtime/c-libs/dl/: For clarity and consistency, renamed unix-dynload-lib.c  ->  posix-dynamic-loading-support.c.  Also, deleted dynload-lib.c (redundant unused crud).
2010-10-18-14.55.51: src/runtime/c-libs/: For clarity and consistency, renamed unix-raise-syserr.c -> posix-raise-SYSTEM_ERROR.c.
2010-10-18-14.45.23: src/runtime/machine-dependent/: For clarity and consistency, renamed unix-fault.c  -> posix-arithmetic-trap-handlers.c.
2010-10-18-14.37.00: src/runtime/machine-dependent/: For clarity and consistency, renamed unix-prof.c   -> posix-profiling-support.c.
2010-10-18-14.23.08: For consistency and clarity, renamed src/runtime/config/gen-unix-sigtbl.c -> src/runtime/config/generate-posix-signal-table.c, src/runtime/config/unix-sigtbl.c -> src/runtime/config/posix-signal-table.c.
2010-10-18-14.04.14: For clarity and consistency, renamed src/runtime/machine-dependent/unix-signal.c -> src/runtime/machine-dependent/posix-signal.c.
2010-10-18-13.55.21: For clarity and consistency, renamed src/lib/std/src/posix/unix-signals.pkg -> src/lib/std/src/posix/posix-signals.pkg. (etc)
2010-09-30-12.40.12: Renamed src/runtime/config/unix-signals.c to src/runtime/config/posix-signals.c as part of standardizing on "posix".  Also renamed src/runtime/config/gen-unix-signals.c src/runtime/config/generate-system-signals.h-for-posix-systems.c for clarity and consistency.
2010-10-18-13.21.47: Renamed src/runtime/main/unix-timers.c -> src/runtime/main/posix-timers.c as part of standardizing on 'posix'.
2010-10-18-13.06.15: Moved src/lib/compiler/codegen/ to src/lib/compiler/backend/lower-half/codegen/ where it belongs.
2010-10-18-11.59.10: Renamed all directories named 'unix' to 'posix' because (1) 'posix' is the same length as 'winix' and 'win32', yielding better parallelism and (2) I am standardizing on 'posix' as the name for generic unixy functionality, reserving 'linux' and such for nonportable platform-specific stuff.
2010-10-14-13.05.03: Renamed src/lib/std/src/posix -> src/lib/std/src/posix-1003.1b for clarity and to free up namespace for renaming src/lib/std/src/unix -> src/lib/std/src/posix. Also, added sh/log-change script.
2010-09-30-12.40.12: Globally renamed make7file to make6file, since we currently only have .make6 files.
2010-09-30-10.41.33: src/app/make7/paths/anchor-dictionary.api, from_native() and from_standard(): Renamed spec -> file_path for clarity.
2010-09-29-23.15.11: src/app/make7/depend/: Renamed build-dependency-graph* -> make-dependency-graph*.
2010-09-29-22.15.40: src/app/make7/depend/build-dependency-graph.api: For a narrower, cleaner interface, dropped unneeded API element 'Oh7_View'.
2010-09-29-22.01.29: src/app/make7/depend/build-dependency-graph.api: For a narrower, cleaner interface, dropped unused API elements 'get', 'Looker' and 'process_exports_of_module_dependencies_summary'(?).
2010-09-29-16.04.22: src/app/make7/o7/raw-syntax-to-module-dependencies-summary.pkg: Random cleaning.
2010-09-29-15.26.13: src/app/make7/depend/build-dependency-graph.pkg:  Random cleaning.
2010-09-29-14.38.36: src/app/make7/depend/intra-library-dependency-graph.pkg: For clarity renamed seq/beq/sbeq -> same_bare_o7/same_iced_o7/same_bare_or_iced_o7.
2010-09-29-14.16.24: src/app/make7/depend/intra-library-dependency-graph.pkg: For readability and to reduce clutter, merged in o7-exports.pkg, which contained only a single five-slot datatype definition.
2010-09-29-13.10.53: Renamed five util/ directories (and a miscutil/ for good measure) to stuff/.  Because 'stuff' is a word.  And a syllable shorter.
2010-09-29-12.54.40: src/app/make7/depend/intra-library-dependency-graph.pkg: For readability, changed O7_IS_ICED (tuple) -> O7_IS_ICED {iced_o7,o7_exports,ith}.
2010-09-28-23.44.05: src/app/make7/o7/bare-o7.pkg: Random cleaning and commenting, including moving Bare_O7 api to separate file.
2010-09-28-22.13.45: For clarity and consistency, renamed 'prec-parser' to 'precedence-parser' in various filenames.
2010-09-28-21.45.21: Pervasively renamed 'polylambda' to 'lambdacode' for consistency with the emerging highcode/lowcode/anormcode/fatecode/treecode/... naming pattern.
2010-09-28-20.27.52: Pervasively renamed 'anormal'    to 'anormcode' to fit the emerging highcode/lowcode/fatecode/treecode/... naming convention for intermediate code representations.
2010-09-28-13.31.49: Pervasively renamed 'codetree'   to 'treecode' throughout compiler for improved consistency with emerging highcode/lowcode/... intermediate code name pattern.
2010-09-28-13.31.49: src/app/make7/freezefile/iced-o7.api:  Eliminated now-redudant accessor functions.
2010-09-28-12.02.39: src/app/make7/freezefile/iced-o7.api: Converted Iced_O7 from an opaque type to a simple public record because it is stupid to do implementation hiding when you have no implementation.
2010-09-28-00.31.46: src/app/make7/depend/inter-library-dependency-graph.pkg:  For clarity and consistency, renamed 'library_path' to 'make6_file'.
2010-09-27-23.59.12: src/app/make7/freezefile/iced-o7.pkg: For consistencty and clarity, renamed 'library' -> 'make6_file'.
2010-09-27-23.42.23: src/app/make7/freezefile/iced-o7.pkg: For clarity and consistency renamed runtime_system_pid -> runtime_system_picklehash.  src/app/make7/semant: Renamed sharing.pkg -> sharing-mode.pkg.
2010-09-27-23.03.08: src/app/make7/freezefile/iced-o7.api: For clarity, renamed 'spec' to 'api_or_pkg_file_path'.
2010-09-27-22.35.03: src/app/make7/freezefile/iced-o7.api: For clarity and consistency, renamed 'new' -> 'make_iced_o7'.
2010-09-27-22.24.30: src/app/make7/freezefile/iced-o7.api: For clarity, changed 'offset' to 'byte_offset_in_freezefile'.
2010-09-27-21.03.18: src/app/make7/freezefile/iced-o7.pkg: Iced_O7: Renamed offset -> byte_offset_in_freezefile for clarity.
2010-09-27-13.12.46: src/app/make7/depend/intra-library-dependency-graph.pkg:  Renamed ith_in_freezefile to just ith.
2010-09-27-13.02.14: src/app/make7/depend/intra-library-dependency-graph.pkg:  For readability, changed Far_Iced_O7 from a triple to a record { filter, iced_o7, ith_in_freezefile }.
2010-09-26-20.32.42: src/app/make7/depend/inter-library-dependency-graph.pkg:  For clarity and consistency, changed 'FROZEN Void -> Void' to 'FROZEN   { clear_pickle_cache:  Void -> Void }'.
2010-09-26-14.26.24: src/app/make7/depend/build-dependency-graph.pkg:  Random cleaning.
2010-09-26-13.25.10: src/app/make7/depend/inter-library-dependency-graph.pkg: For readability, changed Oh7_View from a tuple type to { far_o7_thunk, exports_dictionary, visible_symbols } record type.

2010-09-26-10.34.46: src/app/make7/: Random cleaning and commenting.
2010-09-25-23.54.23: src/app/make7/depend/inter-library-dependency-graph.pkg: Renamed type Sublibrarylist -> Libraries since it is in fact a list of Library, not of Sublibrary (which does not as yet exist).
2010-09-25-13.25.55: src/app/make7/main/compile-server.pkg (etc): Renamed (long-obsoleted) build_directory vars/parameters to generated_filename_infix. The old idea was to put separate compiler builds in separate directories; the new idea is to do (e.g.) foo.pkg.o7 vs foo.pkg.ppc-macos.o7 when cross-compiling or such.
2010-09-24-18.23.28: src/app/make7/make-compiler/backend-per-platform.pkg:  Cleaning and commenting.
2010-09-24-15.35.40: src/app/make7/main/compile-server.pkg: For clarity, renamed enter_server_loop -> enter_compiler_server_loop.
2010-09-24-15.13.30: src/lib/compiler/backend: For clarity, renamed upper/, lower/ -> upper-half/, lower-half/.
2010-09-24-15.00.10: src/app/make7/simple-concurrency/compile-client.api: For clarity, renamed start/stop/kill/reset -> start_compile_server/stop_compile_server/kill_compile_server/reset_compile_server.
2010-09-24-14.28.47: src/app/make7/simple-concurrency/unix-compile-client.pkg: For simplicity, eliminated {name,id} Server_Handle type in favor of just returning Compile_Server records to user as an opaque type.
2010-09-23-23.10.47: src/app/make7/simple-concurrency/unix-compile-client.pkg: Collapse 'server_name server' to 'server.name' etc various places, for brevity and clarity.
2010-09-23-20.52.42: src/app/make7/simple-concurrency/unix-compile-client.pkg: Changed Server=SERVER{...} -> Server={...} for simplicity.
2010-09-23-10.54.59: Pervasively adopt 'fatecode' as name for our continuation-passing-style intermediate code format for clarity, parallelism with 'highcode'/'lowcode'/'treecode' intermediate code format names, and because 'cps' and 'fps' are way too obscure while 'continuation_passing_style' and 'fate_passing_style' are way too verbose.
2010-09-19-12.02.25: src/lib/compiler/backend/upper/: For clarity and consistency renamed fps-optimize -> optimize-fatecode
2010-09-19-11.47.49: Test check-in
2010-09-11-11.51.43: For clarity, renamed src/lib/compiler/backend/upper/fps/ -> src/lib/compiler/backend/upper/fatecode/, added a file src/lib/compiler/backend/upper/fatecode/AAA-README.OVERVIEW.
2010-09-11-11.39.10: For clarity, renamed src/lib/compiler/codegen/compile-fps -> src/lib/compiler/codegen/compile-fatecode.
2010-09-11-11.29.22: src/lib/std/src/unix/spawn.api: For brevity renamed spawn::spawn_process -> spawn::process, spawn::spawn_process_in_environment -> spawn::process_in_environment.
2010-09-11-11.08.27: src/lib/std/src/unix/spawn.api: Killed 'spawn' for insufficient value-added -- it was just spawn_process + streams_of.
2010-09-11-10.57.05: src/lib/std/src/unix/spawn.api: For clarity, streams_of now returns { from_stream, to_stream } instead of (from_stream, to_stream).
2010-09-10-15.29.09: src/lib/std/src/unix/spawn.pkg: Light cleaning.
2010-09-10-15.05.34: Random light cleaning.
2010-09-10-13.40.32: src/app/make7/simple-concurrency/unix-compile-client.pkg: For clarity changed Server_Handle from (Int, String) -> { id: Int, name: String }.
2010-09-10-13.26.12: src/app/make7/simple-concurrency/unix-compile-client.pkg: For readability change 'wait_status (server, TRUE)'  ->  'wait_status { server, echo => TRUE }'.
2010-09-09-19.32.19: Random light cleaning and commenting in src/app/make7/simple-concurrency/unix-compile-client.pkg and kith.
2010-09-09-13.02.14: Favoring clarity over brevity, renamed src/lib/compiler/front/ ->  src/lib/compiler/frontend/.  Similarly, created src/lib/compiler/backend/ and moved into it src/lib/compiler/upper/ and src/lib/compiler/lower/.
2010-09-08-23.34.39: src/lib/compiler/lower/tools/parser/: Renamed mdl.lex, mdl.grammar -> machine-description-language.lex, machine-description-language.grammar.
2010-09-08-23.19.40: src/app/make7/paths/anchor-dictionary.pkg: Light cleaning and commenting.
2010-09-08-19.35.14: src/lib/compiler/execution/main/: Renamed importtree.pkg -> import-tree.pkg for clarity and consistency.
2010-09-08-19.23.09: src/lib/compiler/execution/o7-file/oh7-file.pkg: Light cleaning.
2010-09-08-15.00.07: src/app/make7/compile/compile-treewalk-g.pkg: mythryl.lex.pkg was taking -minutes- to compile. Spent a couple of days tracing the CPU consumption to the prettyprint_fps_function() call in src/lib/compiler/upper/main/backend-g.pkg, invoked during verbose compile.log listings.  Must be an O(N**2) algorithm in there or something.  For now, settled for commenting and commenting-out that call.
2010-09-07-16.45.26: src/lib/compiler/upper/main/backend-g.pkg: Simplified compile.log timestamping code via use of cpu_timer::get_added_cpu_time() call.
2010-09-07-16.45.26: src/lib/std/src/cpu-timer.api: Added convenience calls get_added_cpu_time, get_added_usr_and_sys_cpu_time, get_added_gc_and_nongc_usr_and_sys_cpu_times, the first being probably what most people want most of the time.
2010-09-07-16.04.17: src/lib/std/src: Split timer.pkg into cpu-timer.pkg + wallclock-timer.pkg because there is no code in common.  src/lib/std/src/cpu-timer.pkg: Renamed various functions for clarity.
2010-09-07-11.22.00: src/lib/compiler/upper/main/backend-g.pkg: compile.log logic to compute and print elapsed CPU time, adapted from compile-statistics.pkg.
2010-09-05-21.46.34: src/lib/compiler/front/basics/stats/compile-statistics.pkg: Cleaning and commenting; added say_when_nonzero.  src/app/make7/compile/compile-treewalk-g.pkg: Code to set compile_statistics::say_end on a (hardwired) per-file basis.
2010-09-05-16.59.50: src/lib/std/src/timer.api: For clarity and consistency renamed check_real_timer -> get_elapsed_wallclock_time, check_gc_timer -> get_elapsed_garbage_collector_time, check_cpu_timer -> get_elapsed_cpu_time, check_cpu_timers -> get_elapsed_cpu_times.
2010-09-05-16.38.56: src/lib/std/src/timer.api: For clarity and consistency renamed Real_Timer -> Wallclock_Timer, start_cpu_timer -> make_cpu_timer, total_cpu_timer -> get_cpu_timer, start_real_timer -> make_wallclock_timer, total_real_timer -> get_wallclock_timer.
2010-09-05-11.43.28: Phased out last traces of support for .sig, .sml and .grm file extentions (use .api, .pkg and .grammar); yacc, lex and future-lex now produce .api and .pkg files.
2010-09-04-15.56.07: src/app/yacc/src/yacc.pkg, src/app/make7/tools/mlyacc/tool.pkg: Mythryl yacc now generates .api and .pkg files instead of .sig and .sml files (SML/NJ convention).
2010-09-04-13.48.32: src/app/make7/tools/main/private-tools.pkg: Light cleaning.
2010-09-04-13.17.19: src/app/make7/simple-concurrency/unix-compile-client.pkg, src/app/make7/main/compile-server.pkg: Light cleaning.
2010-09-04-12.56.19: src/app/make7/paths/anchor-dictionary.pkg: Move package synonymous outside package per current convention.
2010-09-03-14.06.35: src/app/make7/util/: Rename symbolset.pkg -> symbol-set.pkg, symbolmap.pkg -> symbol-map.pkg, symbolordkey.pkg symbol-ord-key.pkg
2010-09-01-14.40.50: src/app/make7/compile/compile-treewalk-g.pkg: Light cleaning.  src/app/make7/paths/: Rename srcpathmap.pkg -> source-path-map.pkg, srcpathset.pkg -> source-path-set.pkg
2010-09-01-13.41.58: src/app/make7/make-compiler/make-compiler-g.pkg: Rename 'os' parameter to 'os_kind' for clarity and consistency.
2010-08-31-16.53.02: x-kit/tut/triangle/triangle-app.pkg: check_drawing_window_triangle_draw(): Final assert was failing -- probably a race condition (worked on maw over net) -- commented it out rather than track it down right now.   src/app/make7/main/compile-server.pkg: fun enter_server_loop: Renamed 'load' parameter to 'make'' for consistency.
2010-08-31-15.56.04: src/app/make7/main/make7-g.pkg: Move package abbreviations above generic package per current convention.
2010-08-31-15.09.56: src/lib/std/src/unix/threadkit-winix-process.pkg: Move package abbreviations above main package, per usual convention.
2010-08-10-10.12.14: src/runtime/o/mythryl.c: Back out change wrapping script in { ... }.  src/lib/compiler/front/typechecker/basics/typechecking-control.pkg:  Due to previous, make value_restriction_top_warn once again default to FALSE.
2010-08-04-23.32.31: src/lib/src/gtk-glue.config: Commenting.
2010-08-04-17.12.12: src/runtime/o/mythryl.c: Wrap script in { } to reduce value-restriction issues.  src/lib/compiler/front/typechecker/basics/typechecking-control.pkg: Default value_restriction_top_warn to TRUE.
2010-08-03-14.32.25: src/lib/x-kit/: Added CYNBE-CONCLUSIONS.OVERVIEW.
2010-08-02-18.45.03: x-kit: Renamed realize parameters from { kidplug, window, size } -> { kidplug, window, window_size }.
2010-08-02-10.26.57: src/lib/x-kit/widget/fancy/graphviz/graphviz-widget.pkg: Random cleaning and commenting.
2010-07-31-15.45.33: Moved src/lib/x-kit/tut/show-graph/graph-view/* to src/lib/x-kit/widget/fancy/graphviz/ and src/lib/x-kit/tut/show-graph/text-view/* to src/lib/x-kit/widget/fancy/graphviz/text because these are generally useful re-usable widgets.
2010-07-31-11.13.01: src/lib/x-kit/tut/show-graph/graph-view/: Renamed graph-view* -> scrollable-graphviz-widget*.
2010-07-30-14.43.02: src/lib/x-kit/tut/show-graph/README: Updated.
2010-07-29-22.16.36: Still fiddling with the badbricks-game-app-export.pkg issue.
2010-07-28-18.37.26: Ditto

2010-07-21-09.47.14: src/lib/x-kit/tut/badbricks-game/badbricks-game-app-export.pkg: Did a nop-edit to see if that will humor git -- github apparently lacks this file.
2010-07-19-00.06.39: src/lib/x-kit/tut/show-graph/graph-view/: Renamed graph-viewer.pkg -> graphviz-widget.pkg (etc) for clarity.

2010-07-18-15.38.10: src/lib/x-kit/tut/show-graph/: Show-graph window opening at 1600 rather than 3800 pixels wide under Xinerama seems to be window manager issue, not x-kit issue.

2010-04-26-03.34.40: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/cs-pixmap.pkg: Hacked make_clientside_pixmap_from_window to flush to_topwindow_drawimp but make_clientside_pixmap_from_readwrite_pixmap to flush to_screen_drawimp. This matches the xkit drawing convention; consequently triangle-app now self-checks correctly.
2010-04-26-03.17.26: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/xsession.api et al: Much renaming of fields etc for clarity, in particular to draw a bright line between draw-imps global to a screen and those local to a particular application top-level window and its subwindows.
2010-04-26-00.10.24: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/xsession.api: Renamed SCREEN.screen -> SCREEN.screen_info (it is of type Screen_Info).
2010-04-25-05.07.58: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xdraw.api: Add drawimp_thread_id_of call.  src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xcore.api: Added id_of_window, id_of_rw_pixmap, id_of_ro_pixmap calls.  The problem was that windows etc had no visible identity at the application programmer level, nor was there any easy way to distinguish which ones used which draw imps.  This make useful tracelog debugging of them virtually impossible.
2010-04-24-23.21.05: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/thread.api: Rename get_thread -> get_current_thread; have it throw THREAD_SCHEDULER_NOT_RUNNING rather than return a garbage pointer;  rename get_thread_name -> get_current_thread's_name;  add get_current_thread's_id.  src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg: Include thread_id in tracelog line prologues;  src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/print-if.c: Match columns to revised trace.pkg output format.
2010-04-24-22.45.01: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/internal-threadkit-types.pkg: For clarity and consistency renamed THREAD.id -> THREAD.thread_id.
2010-04-24-22.28.30: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/thread.pkg (etc): Renamed Thread_Id -> Thread everywhere in support of the emerging convention that Foo is a record and Foo_Id is a number.
2010-04-24-20.00.32: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xsocket.pkg: Random internal cleaning and commenting.
2010-04-24-19.19.34: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/: Renamed graphics-context-cache.pkg -> pen-to-gcontext-imp.pkg for clarity.  src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/xsession.pkg: Added draw-imp and pen-to-gcontext-imp to master diagram.
2010-04-24-12.56.52: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/draw-imp.pkg: FLUSH command now signals completion via a condition variable.
2010-04-24-01.47.28: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-time/timeofday.c: Add comments pointing to TSR, HPET and clock_gettime().
2010-04-24-00.26.34: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/: Ripped out ximage.api, ximage.pkg: Too big a can of worms to open right now.
2010-04-22-00.13.16: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/: Renamed rgb-image.api, rgb-image.pkg -> ximage.api, ximage.pkg because they are X-specific and we will probably eventually want a generic rgb_image package.
2010-04-21-23.57.41: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/: Establish rgb-image.api, rgb-image.pkg.
2010-04-21-23.00.46: src/lib/x-kit/: Globally renamed Drawable_Window, DRAWABLE_WINDOW -> Drawable, DRAWABLE.
2010-04-21-13.55.12: src/lib/x-kit/tut/triangle/triangle-app.pkg: Fixed race condition: I was generating simulated mouseclick before setting up the trap to detect its result -- and got bitten despite network roundtrip delay(?!?)
2010-04-20-00.21.34: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/wire-to-value.api: decode_xevent: Document formerly mysterious Bool return value: Tells whether event was synthesized via SendEvent.
2010-04-19-21.28.05: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/cs-pixmap.api: Added same_cs_pixmap call.
2010-04-19-21.08.12: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xgeometry.api: package size: Added eq: (Size, Size) -> Bool.
2010-04-19-20.03.12: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/cs-pixmap.api: Added make_clientside_pixmap_from_window().
2010-04-19-14.30.49: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xsocket.api: Renaming for clarity: request_reply -> send_xrequest_and_read_reply, etc.
2010-04-19-02.01.12: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xsocket.pkg: Tweaked inbuf_imp to do nonblocking reads from X server socket. Now background tasks continue to run properly while x-kit is waiting for user X-event input -- much better!
2010-04-19-00.31.19: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xsocket.pkg: inbuf_imp: Add receive_vector_nonblocking fn as alternative to existing blocking-read X input call.
2010-04-18-23.31.03: src/lib/std/src/socket/socket-guts.pkg: More cleaning and commenting.
2010-04-18-23.19.20: src/lib/std/src/socket/socket-guts.pkg: Cleaning and commenting.
2010-04-18-22.54.31: src/lib/std/src/socket/socket-guts.pkg, src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/setNBIO.c: Cleaning and commenting.
2010-04-18-21.40.49: src/lib/std/src/threadkit/unix/retry-syscall-on-eintr.pkg: Added tracelog support.
2010-04-18-21.06.51: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/thread.pkg: Changed get_thread_name to not call get_thread_id (and thus not SEGV) when thread scheduler is not running. This is a workaround not a fix, but much better than nothing.
2010-04-18-20.34.23: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/thread-scheduler.pkg: Discovered the hard way that calling  get_current_thread = unsafe::get_current_thread_register when thread_scheduler is not running can SEGV you.  E.g., calling thread::get_thread_name will do this. Documented with a comment.
2010-04-18-17.18.51: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg: Eliminated much needless use of thread/mailslot functionality in order to make print_if tracelogging usable in a wider range of environments.
2010-04-17-23.44.49: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/thread-scheduler.pkg: Added tracelog support and instrumentation. (thread-scheduler is an awkward special case because the regular thread/mailslot based mechanism does not work inside thread-scheduler itself, and also due to a package-cycle problem.)
2010-04-17-18.03.18: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-runtime/cfun-list.h: Change setIntTimer -> setIntervalTimer for clarity.
2010-04-17-14.54.02: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/xsession.api: Added some TO-DO rumination on suporting David Patternson's warthog/trampoline capability/interface model in the evolving Mythryl concurrency/OOP paradigm.
2010-04-16-23.55.16: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-runtime/setitimer.c, src/runtime/machine-dependent/unix-signal.c: Additional instrumentation via print_if.
2010-04-16-13.30.00: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/geometry.pkg: Import src/lib/x-kit/tut/plaid/plaid-app.pkg: symmetric_difference(box,box) as box::xor, since it is of general utility.
2010-04-15-23.25.16: src/lib/x-kit/tut/plaid/plaid-app.pkg: Random cleaning and commenting.
2010-04-15-22.25.10: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/draw-types.api etc: Renamed screen_depth -> screen_depth_imps because the former sounds like an integer; renamed id -> pixmap_id various places for clarity.
2010-04-14-13.33.59: src/lib/x-kit/tut/triangle/: Deleted tri.out, tri.out1. These were apparently years-old object code files or some such. Junk.
2010-04-13-20.06.16: src/lib/x-kit/tut/xkit-tut-unit-test.pkg: triangle_app::selfcheck () now runs sucessfully.
2010-04-13-19.49.37: src/lib/x-kit/tut/xkit-tut-unit-test.pkg:  Establish this new unit test file, integrate into make check framework.
2010-04-13-18.03.37: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xgeometry.api: Dropped various now-unneeded _of suffixes.
2010-04-13-17.28.33: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xgeometry.api: Renamed bounding_box -> point::bounding_box, within -> point::in_box.
2010-04-13-17.07.53: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xgeometry.api: Similarly established (sub) package box.
2010-04-13-16.26.26: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xgeometry.api: Established (sub) package size, moved into it add_size, sub_size, scale_size as add, subtract, scale.
2010-04-13-16.09.01: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xgeometry.api: Moved limit_pt into package point as clip; Moved add_size_to_pt into package point as add_size. Re-ordered arguments to point::scale to put point first.
2010-04-13-15.50.50: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xgeometry.api: Established (sub) package point; moved into it point_00, row_coord_of_pt, col_coord_of_pt, scale_point, add_points, subtract_points, point_ne, point_eq, point_gt, point_lt, point_ge, point_le as zero, row_coord_of, col_coord_of, scale, add, subtract, ne, eq, gt, lt, ge, le.
2010-04-13-15.34.20: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xgeometry.api: Added point_ne, point_ge, point_gt to complete the traditional (hence expected) set.
2010-04-13-15.09.29: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xgeometry.api: Renamed less_than_pt, less_eq_point -> point_lt, point_le; added point_eq.
2010-04-13-15.09.29: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xgeometry.api: Renamed add_pt, sub_pt -> add_points, subtract_points.
2010-04-13-03.11.59: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/xsession.pkg: send_mousebutton_press_xevent, send_mousebutton_release_xevent: I had x=row, y=col, oops. Fixed by reversing them.
2010-04-13-02.06.49: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/value-to-wire.api: For clarity renamed pt -> point, str -> string various places.
2010-04-13-01.50.00: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/xsocket-to-topwindow-router.api: Renamed note_window's_seen_first_expose_oneshot -> note_window's_''seen_first_expose''_oneshot for clarity -- and because I can. :-)
2010-04-12-23.11.53: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/xsession.api: Renamed drawop_sink -> to_drawimp, which is both shorter and clearer.
2010-04-12-22.48.29: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/xsession.api: Rename draw_command_sink -> drawop_sink for brevity.
2010-04-12-14.59.02: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/value-to-wire.api: More work establishing a clear distinction between gc records and 29-bit gc IDs.
2010-04-12-01.23.34: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/graphics-context-cache.pkg: Work at maintaining clearer distinction between gc records and 29-bit integer gc ID values.
2010-04-12-01.23.34: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/draw.pkg: Moved Text+Text_Item into their own package t, dropped the TEXT_ prefixes.
2010-04-12-01.08.09: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/draw-types.api: For clarity and namespace sanity, moved Draw_Root into its own package r, renamed DWIN -> WINDOW, DPM -> PIXMAP.
2010-04-12-00.54.56: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/draw.pkg: Nuke another bloody include.
2010-04-11-20.15.01: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/draw-types.api: Renamed draw_fn -> draw_command_sink for clarity.
2010-04-11-19.20.27: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/draw-imp.pkg: More random tidying.
2010-04-11-18.55.57: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/draw-imp.api: For clarity renamed package c -> s, within it Config -> Mapped_State, MAP -> TOPWINDOW_IS_NOW_MAPPED, UNMAP -> TOPWINDOW_IS_NOW_UNMAPPED.
2010-04-11-17.37.23: src/lib/compiler/front/parse/lex/mythryl-token-table-g.pkg: Killed the "&&" and "||" reserved words. These were synonyms of "and" and "or" intended to comfort C programmers, but they do not get used enough to justify keeping them around.
2010-04-11-16.46.00: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/draw-imp.api: Moved Destroy_Item into its own package d to get rid of distracting DESTROY_ prefix.

2010-04-11-14.24.02: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/draw-imp.api: Moved Draw_Op into its own package o to eliminate the bloody DOP_ prefixes.
2010-04-11-14.10.15: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/draw-imp.pkg: Squished another bloody-bedamned include statement.
2010-04-11-13.58.31: Random cleaning and commenting in src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/draw-imp.pkg, src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/value-to-wire-core.pkg.

2010-04-07-15.04.05: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/window.api: Added seen_first_expose_oneshot_of call. Also supporting version in src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/xsocket-to-topwindow-router.api.
2010-04-07-01.40.36: triangle-app.pkg had stopped working; traced to not including new NOTE_EXPOSE_AND_SEND_TO_WINDOW case in xevent_action_to_string() in src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/xsocket-to-topwindow-router.pkg. Lesson: Do not ignore compiler not exhaustive warnings. :-)
2010-04-06-12.59.53: Added logic to signal when a widget is up and running, interpreted as meaning when its first EXPOSE event arrives from the X server. This comprises seen_first_redraw_oneshot_of() in src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/widget.api plus as supporting infrastructure note_seen_first_expose_oneshot in src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/window.api and note_window's_seen_first_expose_oneshot in src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/xsocket-to-topwindow-router.api.
2010-04-05-16.24.44: Changed tacks: Widgets do not know their sizes, instead they know their window and their window knows its size (and position). Consequently: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/widget.api: Dropped note_new_size(). src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/widget.pkg: Dropped WIDGET.size field.
2010-04-05-00.29.57: src/lib/std/: Tidying in various vector packages.
2010-04-04-14.15.15: src/lib/std/src/rw-float64-vector.pkg: Random cleaning.

2010-04-03-00.02.46: More cleaning and commenting, centering on src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/xsocket-to-topwindow-router.pkg.
2010-04-02-18.19.03: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/xsocket-to-topwindow-router.pkg: Still more general cleaning.
2010-04-02-18.00.54: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/xsocket-to-topwindow-router.pkg: More general cleaning.
2010-04-02-17.40.48: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/xsocket-to-topwindow-router.pkg: General cleaning, more work establishing a clear distinction between window and window_id values.
2010-04-02-03.02.51: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/window.pkg: Move window_point_to_screen_point def to src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/xsession.pkg to break a package cycle.
2010-04-02-02.23.54: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/window.api: Renamed window_pt_to_screen_pt -> window_point_to_screen_point. What is it about programming and dyslexia? :-)
2010-04-02-02.10.27: Globally renamed translate_coords -> translate_coordinates. Remember, every time you mangle a word, God kills a kitten. Think of the kittens.
2010-04-02-01.50.42: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xtypes.pkg: Renamed subpackage wa -> a per new package naming convention.
2010-04-02-01.29.18: src/lib/x-kit/: Pervasively changed 'package w = widget;' -> 'package wg = widget;' in support of below package-name convention.
2010-04-02-00.44.29: src/lib/x-kit/: Pervasively changed 'package g = geometry;' -> 'package ge = geometry;' in support of below package-name convention.
2010-04-02-00.13.29: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/window.api: Renamed packages wa, cfg -> a, c. (Adopting convention that organizational subpackages have one-char names.)

2010-03-21-21.15.40: src/lib/x-kit/tut/triangle/triangle-app.pkg: make_draw_threads:  Changed to draw triangles in green -- apparently at some point I accidentally changed it to draw black triangles on a black background, which looks unimpressive to say the least. :-) triangle-app now appears to be basically functional! :-) :-) :-)
2010-03-20-14.38.44: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xsocket.pkg: sequencer_imp_main_loop: FIXED: I had incorrectly transformed   fun loop x = loop( select ... ); -> fun loop x = for (;;) { select ... ; }; in a case where the  select  returned a non-Void value.

2010-03-10-03.05.01: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/color/: Split x11-color-name.pkg off from rgb24.pkg, partly to avoid cyclicity problems, partly because it is better in a separate package anyhow.
2010-03-10-03.05.01: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/color/yiq.pkg: Total rewrite. :-)
2010-03-10-01.59.35: Globally renamed xrgb -> rgb24, taking 24-bitness as primary and X protocol applications as secondary.

2010-03-07-21.51.27: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/stuff/xserver-info-to-string.pkg:  Improve formatting. (Considerably!)  src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/value-to-wire.api: encode_create_window: Rename io -> io_class for clarity.  src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/window-io.api: create_window: Rename io -> io_class for clarity and consistency.  src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xtypes.pkg: Rename Input_Output -> Io_Class for clarity and consistency.

2010-03-05-19.16.13: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/: For clarity and consistency rename xevent-to-topwindow-router.pkg ->  xsocket-to-topwindow-router.pkg, widgettree-root-xevent-router.pkg -> topwindow-to-widget-router.pkg. Break out xsocket-to-topwindow-router.api as a separate file.
2010-03-05-18.40.04: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/: Renamed xbuf-to-widgettree-xevent-router.pkg -> xevent-to-topwindow-router.pkg for conciseness, perhaps slightly improved clarity.

2010-03-05-01.44.23: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xsocket.pkg: outbuf_imp: loop() was ignoring max_bytes_per_socket_write, clearly a bug: Fixed.  Much commenting.

2010-03-03-01.29.58: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/display.pkg: Dusty Deboer had ad-hoc retry logic hammered in on X-server connect and read-reply. Removed the former; naive retry will not work for connect() anyhow.  Replaced the latter (which is in fact needed due to 50Hz SIGALRM generating EINTRs in recv.c) with better-written pre-existing retry_syscall_on_eintr code.
2010-03-02-03.14.36: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-c.h: Tweaked RAISE_SYSERR and RAISE_ERROR to correctly report both file and line number (e.g., foo.c:13 instead of just foo.c) for C-originated Mythryl exceptions.

2010-03-01-16.14.36: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/: Created xsession.api -- kinda crazy for a module as big as xsession.pkg to have no explicit API definition.
2010-03-01-14.52.35: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/stuff/xclient-unit-test.pkg: Cleanly close tracelog at end, using new tracing::currently_tracing_to() fn.

2010-02-28-22.36.46: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xcore.api and elsewhere: Renamed BAD_ADDRESS -> XSERVER_CONNECT_ERROR for clarity.
2010-02-28-20.58.03: Changed *.LOAD_LOG -> *.load.log to further reduce the shouting.
2010-02-28-20.34.43: Generate foo.make6.index files instead of foo.make6.INDEX files, to reduce the shouting.
2010-02-28-16.34.25: For improved clarity, globally changed foo.make6.a7 freezefile names to foo.make6.frozen.
2010-02-28-15.30.34: Generate .compile.log files instead of .COMPILE_LOG files -- got tired of the shouting.
2010-02-28-14.42.34: Makefile: Added rest-a7-clean target to remove the freezefiles (.a7 files) created by doing make rest.
2010-02-26-22.31.12: Backed out all those proactive EINTR retries pending better understanding -- see discussion at bottom of src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/connect.c
2010-02-26-21.30.16: Quite a bit of fiddling. In particular: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/hexdump-if.c: Wrote this to provide classic hex+ascii tracelogging of socket traffic.  src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/stuff/xclient-unit-test.pkg: Changed this to pass authentication info to open_xdisplay; now succeeds in contacting X server and decoding connect request reply. Also did some fiddling to make authentication.pkg visible and usable both inside and outside xclient library, and to get type sharing right.
2010-02-24-03.11.51: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xauthentication.(api,pkg): Commenting.
2010-02-23-23.44.26: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xauthentication.(api,pkg): Commenting.
2010-02-23-22.26.32: src/runtime/c-libs/: More proactive EINTR retries. NB: JHReppy emailed that not retrying on EINTR at the C level was a deliberate SML/NJ design decision. Fair enough, although it makes my hair stand on end.
2010-02-23-12.33.18: src/runtime/c-libs/posix-os/poll.c: Proactively handle EINTR. Change wahtever -> whatever in previous fixes, also status == -1 to status < 0, which seems traditional for some reason.
2010-02-23-04.18.29: src/runtime/c-libs/posix-io/: Proactively handle EINTR in close.c, dup2.c, dup.c, fcntl_d.c, fcntl_gfd.c, fcntl_gfl.c, fcntl_l_64.c, fcntl_l.c, fcntl_sfd.c, fcntl_sfl.c, readbuf.c, read.c, writebuf.c, write.c.
2010-02-23-03.51.55: src/runtime/c-libs/posix-filesys/: Proactively handle EINTR errors in openf.c, ftruncate.c, ftruncate_64.c.
2010-02-23-03.21.54: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/connect.c: Added a select() loop to handle EINTR during connect(), per Unix Network Programming p452.
2010-02-23-02.10.44: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/: Proactively add retries on EINTR to various calls because with a 50HZ SIGALRM running to support concurrency, interrupted calls are a significant potential problem.
2010-02-23-00.23.14: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xcore.api: For clarity, renamed Authentication,AUTHENTICATION -> Xauthentication,XAUTHENTICATION, similar renamings elsewhere.
2010-02-22-23.36.17: src/lib/x-kit/: draw/get-display(api,pkg) had nothing to do with drawing and no real distinction from xclient/xauthentication(api,pkg) functionality, so merged former into latter to reduce clutter and rationalize. For clarity, renamed fn parse_display -> parse_xdisplay_string, fn get_display -> get_xdisplay_string_and_xauthentication.
2010-02-22-23.02.55: src/lib/x-kit/: X authentication has nothing to do with X drawing, so moved x11-authentication.(api,pkg) from draw/ -> xclient/, renaming to xauthentication.(api,pkg) for stylistic consistency with the other files there.
2010-02-22-22.44.25: src/lib/x-kit/draw/x11-authentication.api: For clarity, renamed auth_file_name -> get_xauthority_filename, get_auth_by_addr -> get_xauthority_file_entry_by_address, get_best_auth_by_addr -> get_best_xauthority_file_entry_by_address, read_authentication_file -> get_selected_xauthority_file_entries, auth_names -> acceptable_authentication_methods.
2010-02-22-22.03.28: src/lib/x-kit/draw/: For clarity renamed xauth.api,xauth.pkg -> x11-authentication.api,x11-authentication.pkg.
2010-02-22-02.39.44: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/: sendbuf.c, recv.c: More tracelog print_if stuff.
2010-02-22-00.20.26: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/socket.c: Added much tracelog support. src/lib/std/src/socket/socket-guts.pkg: ctl_rcvbuf was bound to ctlSNDBUF instead of ctlRCVBUF. (Should maybe fix this in SML/NJ.) src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/*.c: Commenting.
2010-02-21-11.46.34: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-time/timeofday.c: Make return (sec,usec) value available at C (as well as Mythryl) level.  src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/print-if.c: Use preceding to timestamp tracelog messages in format matching print_if from src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg. Also, support printf-style formatting via vsnprintf.
2010-02-21-03.50.40: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/: Rename settracefn.c -> setprintiffn.c, add print-if.c to do actual trace logging from C code.
2010-02-21-01.53.21: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/: Create settracefn.c to support C-level tracing coordinated with tracing.pkg.  src/lib/std/src/socket/internet-socket.pkg: Add set_trace_fd call providing access to preceding.
2010-02-21-01.10.34: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg: Add logic to pry Unix fd out of Output_Stream value.
2010-02-20-23.10.59: src/lib/std/src/io/pure-io.api: Tidying.
2010-02-20-22.53.20: src/lib/std/src/posix/posix-io.pkg: Tidying.
2010-02-20-22.06.00: src/lib/std/src/posix/posix-io.pkg: Tidying, renaming for clarity.
2010-02-20-15.12.56: src/lib/std/src/io/file-g.pkg: Tidying.
2010-02-20-14.12.59: src/lib/std/src/: Renamed Base-imp.make6 -> stdlib-core.make6 for clarity and to reserve "imp" for threadservers.
2010-02-20-13.45.53: src/lib/std/src/unsafe/cinterface.pkg and kith: Light commenting and tidying.
2010-02-20-13.05.52: src/runtime/c-libs/unix-raise-syserr.c: Save errno value early to be on the safe side.
2010-02-20-11.31.32: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xsocket.pkg: Implement and export bytes_to_hex, bytes_to_ascii, string_to_hex, string_to_ascii. (They belong elsewhere.)  src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/display.pkg: More trace print_ifs taking advantage of preceding.
2010-02-20-02.56.46: src/runtime/c-libs/unix-raise-syserr.c and kith:  Commenting.
2010-02-20-02.02.54: src/lib/std/src/socket/socket-guts.pkg: Tidying.
2010-02-19-17.28.39: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/display.pkg: Trace listing of generated socket. src/lib/std/src/socket/internet-socket.pkg: Added to_string() to support previous.
2010-02-19-16.41.34: src/lib/std/src/socket/internet-socket.pkg: Tidying.
2010-02-19-16.14.28: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-c.h: Report line number as well as filename in RAISE_SYSERR and RAISE_ERROR macros.
2010-02-19-13.54.29: src/lib/std/src/: Renamed string-conversion.api,string-conversion.pkg -> number-string.api,number-string.pkg for brevity and clarity -- they are more about numbers than strings.
2010-02-19-13.08.32: src/lib/std/src/socket/: Renamed unix-generic-socket.pkg -> generic-socket.pkg for clarity and as part of concentrating on being posix-centric rather than cross-platform-centric.
2010-02-19-12.58.16: src/lib/std/src/string-conversion.api: For clarity, renamed Realfmt -> Real_Format and DEC/BIN/OCT -> DECIMAL/BINARY/OCTAL.
2010-02-19-12.04.32: src/lib/std/src/: Removed word.api, which was apparently just an old and unused copy of unt.api.
2010-02-19-11.53.09: src/lib/std/src/: Contents of word.api, unt.api were nearly identical; renamed div,mod -> /,% to make them fully identical.
2010-02-18-22.15.18: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/crack-xserver-address.api: Added to_string.  src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/display.pkg: connect_to_xserver: Addional tracing.
2010-02-18-20.42.49: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/crack-xserver-address.api: Renamed INET_ADDR -> INET_ADDRESS for clarity. src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/display.pkg: connect_to_xserver: Additional tracing printouts.
2010-02-18-20.17.09: src/lib/internet/socket-stuff.pkg: Light cleaning.
2010-02-18-19.46.24: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/display.pkg: say_hello_to_xserver: retry: Log exceptions caught by name instead of silently discarding.
2010-02-18-16.39.35: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg: Tweak and date generated tracelog header. src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/stuff/xclient-unit-test.pkg: Remove an inappropriate newline.
2010-02-18-16.15.14: src/lib/std/src/time.api: Got tired of the redundancy of time::get_time(), changed it to time::get(). Added some comments.  Makefile: somewhat-clean: Remove all .log files.
2010-02-18-12.06.32: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/display.pkg: Write to tracelog X server connection request reply. Minor cleaning.
2010-02-17-23.18.23: x-kit/xclient/src/stuff/xclient-unit-test.pkg: Fetch value of DISPLAY environment variable.
2010-02-17-22.51.09: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/stuff/xclient-unit-test.pkg: Start up and shut down thread scheduler.
2010-02-17-22.35.03: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/stuff/xclient-unit-test.pkg: Set up to log trace messages to xclient-unit-test-trace.log.
2010-02-17-21.20.32: src/lib/core/internal/make7.api: Added mkdir, rename, rmdir, symlink, unlink -- all basic scripting functions posix folk expect to find readily available.
2010-02-17-20.00.36: src/lib/std/src/io/: For simplicity and consistency renamed threadkit-text-io-g.pkg, thread_text_io_g -> threadkit-file-g.pkg, threadkit_file_g.
2010-02-17-19.46.12: src/lib/std/src/io/: For simplicity and consistency renamed threadkit-text-io.api, Threadkit_Text_Io -> threadkit-file.api, Threadkit_File.

2010-02-17-19.04.06: src/lib/std/src/io/: Renamed text-io.api -> file.api (and Text_Io -> File) for simplicity and consistency.
2010-02-17-18.30.46: src/lib/std/src/unix/: Renamed posix-file.pkg -> file.pkg because the package it contains is named file, to avoid confusion with src/lib/std/src/posix/posix-file.pkg, and because I want to make Mythryl posix-centric rather than primarily cross-platform.
2010-02-17-14.31.33: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/stuff/xclient-unit-test.pkg: (Re-)Established this unit test: Now is is run by src/lib/test/all-unit-tests.pkg (like all unit tests) but compiled by src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xclient-internals.make6 so as to have access to internal xclient packages for testing. This is probably a better pattern for large libraries than having all unit tests compiled by src/lib/test/unit-tests.make6, my previous approach.
2010-02-16-02.13.58: src/app/make7/main/make7-g.pkg: Bugfix for parsing -Cfoo=bar commandline switches, contributed by Jeffrey Lau (thanks!)

2010-02-09-14.51.41: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/window-io.api: Dropped the irritating XWV_ prefixes off the Xwin_Val constructors.
2010-02-09-14.30.22: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/: wire-to-value.pkg: Synthesized a matching wire-to-value.api starting with interactive show_pkg() output.
2010-02-09-13.31.50: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/: Merged the (tiny) wire-encoding.pkg into (huge) value-to-wire.pkg to simplify the programmer's model.
2010-02-09-13.09.23: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/value-to-wire.pkg: Synthesized a matching value-to-wire.api starting with interactive show_pkg() output.

2010-02-01-00.13.04: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/stuff/: Renamed mlx-err.pkg -> gripe.pkg because it is shorter, sharper -- and traditional. Ah, tradition!
2010-01-31-23.29.26: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/: Renamed get-server-address.pkg -> crack-xserver-address.pkg, since that is what it turns out to do.

2010-01-31-15.40.05: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/protocol/: Renamed wire-to-xreplies.pkg -> wire-to-value.pkg (more accurate -- it handles X replies, but also X events and X errors).
2010-01-31-15.27.08: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/protocol/: Renamed xerrors.pkg -> protocol-errors.pkg.

2010-01-30-14.13.21: src/lib/x-kit/lib/client-interface/: Renamed iccc.pkg -> xselection.pkg for clarity and coherency.

2010-01-29-23.35.28: src/lib/x-kit/lib/client-interface/: I like a simple one-package-per-file approach, so I broke build.pkg up into drawing.pkg, font.pkg, geometry-2d.pkg, iccc.pkg, standard-xcursors.pkg, xcore.pkg, xinput.pkg, xkit-window.pkg.

2010-01-28-21.10.53: src/lib/x-kit/widget/fancy/2d-graphics/: Renamed Makefile.make6 -> xkit-widget-fancy-graphics2d.make6. Trivial, since the code in this directory is not currently compiled -- or compilable.

2010-01-28-13.04.23: src/lib/x-kit/lib/user: Renamed x-kit.pkg -> xkit.pkg
2010-01-28-12.38.45: src/lib/x-kit/lib/: Renamed util/ -> hash/ because it contains hashing code; Renamed misc/ -> stuff/ because 'stuff' is at least an English word.

2010-01-27-00.38.25: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/widget-cable.pkg: Renamed MOMPLUG.to_mom' -> MOMPLUG.from_kid'. (Previous name was Just Plain Wrong -- my bad.)

2010-01-24-20.36.59: src/lib/x-kit/widget/: Globally renamed widget_of -> as_widget because it is a coercion, not an element fetch.

2010-01-24-12.26.43: src/lib/x-kit/widget/lib/: Renamed button-set.pkg -> button-group.pkg to conform to contemporary usage, and because it manages a list, not a set.

2010-01-23-22.44.21: src/lib/x-kit/widget/node/: Renamed shape-preference-wrapper.pkg -> size-preference-wrapper.pkg for consistency, various internal related renaming.

2010-01-23-13.57.24: src/lib/x-kit/widget/: Created node/ because I want to distinguish between child-owning widgets which do/not do nontrivial layout.  Moved background.pkg, border.pkg and shape-constraint.pkg into it.
2010-01-23-13.40.59: src/lib/x-kit/widget/layout/border.api: Renamed make_border { ... widget ... } -> child because that is what it is -- why be coy\?
2010-01-23-13.12.29: src/lib/x-kit/widget/layout/: Renamed frame.pkg -> border.pkg because all the docs and comments describe it as drawing a border -- why not call a spade a spade\?

2010-01-22-23.05.02: src/lib/x-kit/widget/layout/line-of-widgets.api: Renamed WBOX to WIDGET because that is what it bloody well is -- why be coy?

2010-01-22-21.39.29: src/lib/x-kit/widget/layout/scrollbar-layout.api: Remove spuriously exported w (widget) package. That sort of empty generalization reduces readability pointlessly.
2010-01-22-20.18.19: src/lib/x-kit/widget/: Renamed compound/ -> layout/ for brevity, clarity, and because the main business of and distinctions between them are their window layout algorithms.

2010-01-16-17.29.15: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/widget.api: Renamed size_constraint_thunk_of -> size_constraint_of. (Correcting overshoot in previous code transform.)

2010-01-15-21.12.20: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/widget-base.api: Renamed Dim,DIM -> Int_Constraint,INT_CONSTRAINT because that is what they bloody well are. :-)
2010-01-15-20.20.06: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/widget-base.api: Rename Bounds -> Widget_Shape_Constraints.
2010-01-15-19.07.48: src/lib/x-kit/graphlib/cartouche.api:  Replaced c_wid,c_ht cryptonym parameters with single corner_radius parameter for clarity, brevity and convenience.
2010-01-15-17.02.51: src/lib/x-kit/lib/iccc/xatom.pkg,atom-imp.pkg: Renamed intern_atom -> make_atom because 'intern' is not a word; renamed lookup_atom -> find_atom because 'lookup' is a noun, not a verb; renamed name_of_atom -> atom_to_string because that is more precise.
2010-01-15-04.32.09: src/lib/x-kit/lib/user/drawing.api: For clarity renamed feedback() -> make_unbuffered_drawable() and create_overlay() -> make_locked_window(). (The latter appears unused and perhaps not fully implemented.)

2010-01-13-18.22.14: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed pen-rep.pkg -> pen-guts.pkg because 'guts' is an honest, pungent Anglo-Saxon word while 'rep' is just the gray shade of a word wanna-be.
2010-01-13-16.14.45: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/window.pkg: Renamed map_window,unmap_window -> show_window,hide_window, because 'map' is a terrible word anyhow, plus it has strong unrelated associations in Mythryl.
2010-01-13-15.16.51: src/lib/x-kit/lib/iccc/iccc-property.pkg: Rename Size_Hints -> Window_Manager_Size_Hint, Window_Manager_Hints -> Window_Manager_Hint.

2010-01-12-16.00.25: src/lib/x-kit/: Globally renamed geometry_of_ -> shape_of_ because 'geometry' is way too long relative to frequency of use. (Zipf lives!)

2010-01-12-14.28.54: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed image.pkg -> clientside-window.pkg to work in 'window' tie noun, because 'image' is over-used and vague, and because that is what they in fact are.
2010-01-12-13.32.01: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed tile.pkg -> readonly-window.pkg -- because that is what they in fact are.
2010-01-12-12.44.42: src/lib/x-kit/lib/: Changed mind, 'window' is a better tie-noun than 'pixmap' here. Renamed pixmap/ back to window/.  Renamed window/offscreen-pixmap.pkg -> window/offscreen-window.pkg.
2010-01-12-12.08.47: src/lib/x-kit/lib/: Renamed window/ -> pixmap/.
2010-01-12-11.26.58: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed rw-pixmap.pkg to offscreen-pixmap.pkg. (Decided to use 'pixmap' as the tie noun for drawables.)

2010-01-11-23.16.58: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/draw-types.pkg: Renamed WSRC,PMSRC,TSRC -> FROM_WINDOW,FROM_PIXMAP,FROM_TILE for clarity.

2010-01-11-15.47.02: src/lib/x-kit/lib/user/geometry-2d.api: Renamed origin_of_box,corner_of_box -> upperleft_of_box,lowerright_of_box because there are no points for obscurity in open source.
2010-01-11-15.09.42: src/lib/x-kit/: Renamed graph-util/ -> graphlib/.
2010-01-11-14.45.16: src/lib/x-kit/widget/: Renamed util/ to the more traditional lib/.
2010-01-11-14.27.44: src/lib/x-kit/widget/: Renamed composite/ -> compound/.  Saves a syllable!
2010-01-11-14.13.27: src/lib/x-kit/widget/: Renamed basics/ -> basic/.
2010-01-11-13.55.38: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basics/topwindow.pkg: Rename init() -> start(), because that is what it does, and because 'start' at least is an actual word! :-)
2010-01-11-13.42.22: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basics/: Renamed shell.pkg -> topwindow.pkg, because it has nothing to do with bash or tcsh and everything to do with toplevel application windows.
2010-01-11-12.53.52: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed xtopwwindow-xevent-router-imp.pkg -> xbuf-to-widgettree-xevent-router.pkg. Renamed top-level-window.pkg -> widgettree-root-xevent-router.pkg.
2010-01-11-04.03.45: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed window-lock-imp.pkg -> topwindows-xevent-router-imp.pkg. (Locking turns out to be only a secondary function of this imp.)
2010-01-11-03.06.58: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed keymap.pkg -> keymap-imp.pkg, since it in fact implements an imp.
2010-01-11-02.21.07: src/lib/x-kit/lib/iccc/: Renamed xatoms.pkg -> xatom.pkg. (I reserve plural names for packages implementing collections.)
2010-01-11-01.55.16: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/xsession.pkg: Strip dippy dpy_ prefixes from request* and flush function names.
2010-01-11-01.37.09: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/xsession.pkg: Random cleanup.
2010-01-11-01.01.25: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed display.pkg -> xsession.pkg because the display/xdisplay distinction was confusing, and because it in fact manages the X session.
2010-01-10-23.24.58: src/lib/x-kit/lib/protocol/: Renamed xclient-socket.pkg -> xsocket.pkg etc.
2010-01-10-22.23.32: src/lib/x-kit/example/: Renamed widgets/ -> widget/. src/lib/x-kit/style/: Renamed styles-g.pkg -> style-g.pkg.
2010-01-10-22.00.41: src/lib/x-kit/: Renamed styles/ -> style/, demos/ -> demo/.
2010-01-10-21.48.27: src/lib/x-kit/: Renamed examples/ -> example/.
2010-01-10-21.36.04: src/lib/x-kit/: Renamed widgets/ -> widget/ because plural directory names are just wasted bandwidth.
2010-01-10-21.09.50: src/lib/x-kit/widgets: Renamed simple/ -> leaf/ for brevity -- and because widget-hierarchy leaf widgets are often far from simple!
2010-01-10-15.48.47: src/lib/x-kit/lib/protocol/: Renamed xcvtfns.pkg -> xprotocol-wire-encoding.pkg -- because that is what the package does! :-)
2010-01-10-13.25.16: src/lib/x-kit/lib/protocol/: Renamed xio.pkg -> xsocket-client.pkg, because what it actually does is manage X client socket I/O.
2010-01-10-03.23.24: src/lib/x-kit/: Even more request -> plea renaming.
2010-01-10-01.38.48: src/lib/x-kit/: Yup, still more request -> plea renaming.
2010-01-09-22.46.38: src/lib/x-kit/: Still more request -> plea renaming.
2010-01-09-22.10.24: src/lib/x-kit/widgets/simple/: Renamed label-bttn-view.pkg -> labelled-button-view.pkg, similarly the pkg.
2010-01-09-20.37.42: src/lib/x-kit/: More request -> plea renaming.
2010-01-09-20.02.29: src/lib/x-kit/: Much renaming of req and request -> plea, for brevity and clarity.
2010-01-09-18.48.25: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed draw-master.pkg -> draw-imp.pkg and pkg draw_master -> draw_imp.
2010-01-09-15.00.44: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed window-registry.pkg -> window-lock-imp.pkg, etc.
2010-01-09-02.01.31: src/lib/x-kit/lib/protocol/: Renamed xreply.pkg -> wire-to-xreplies.pkg; Renamed pkg xreply -> wire_to_xreplies.
2010-01-08-21.46.19: src/lib/x-kit/lib/protocol/: Renamed xrequest.pkg -> xrequest-to-wire.pkg; Renamed pkg xrequest -> xrequest_to_wire.
2010-01-08-20.07.48: src/lib/x-kit/lib/protocol/: Rename xprottypes.pkg -> xprotocol-types.pkg.
2010-01-08-17.34.19: src/lib/x-kit/lib/protocol/: Renamed xevttypes.pkg -> xevent-types.pkg, cleanup in xio.pkg, split off xio.api from xio.pkg.
2010-01-07-23.47.07: src/lib/x-kit/lib/protocol/xerrors.pkg: Rename XERR -> XERROR, Xerr_Kind -> Xerror_Kind.
2010-01-05-19.11.16: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg: Cosmetic tweaks to print_if output line format.
2010-01-05-18.51.00: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg: Added print_tracetree () for interactive convenience.
2010-01-05-18.27.39: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg: Generate explanatory headers for tracelog files. No, that is not unixy. But I like non-mysterious.
2010-01-05-18.06.19: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg: Increase print_if timestamp resolution from milliseconds to microseconds. Change ancestors() to return a list of names rather than nodes. (More useful.)
2010-01-05-17.46.04: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg: Tweak print_if to log name of controlling tracetree node.
2010-01-05-17.19.50: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg:  Tweaked make_trace_tree_leaf to raise an exception for duplicate node name, instead of returning pre-existing node. Replaced module_of by node_by_name which searches by name rather than full_name (i.e., by local notname instead of by a /path/name).
2010-01-05-16.32.25: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg: Replaced TRACE_TREE_NODE.full_name field with TRACE_TREE_NODE.parent field, killed module_of(), added exported parent() and ancestors() functions.
2010-01-05-15.50.57: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg: Adopt the convention that TRACE_TREE_NODE.label (renamed TRACE_TREE_NODE.name) is foo::tracing or such -- commandline expression for controlling node.
2010-01-05-15.26.15: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg: Adopt the convention that TRACE_TREE_NODE.label (renamed TRACE_TREE_NODE.name) is foo::tracing or such -- commandline expression for controlling node.
2010-01-05-14.48.42: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg: Added timestamping to print_if(); Moved newline generation responsibility from print_if() callers to print_if() itself.
2010-01-05-12.35.00: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.api: Added a long top-of-file OVERVIEW comment section.
2010-01-05-12.35.00: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg: Renaming for clarity: status -> subtree_nods_and_tracing_flags, set_trace_file (TRACE_TO_FILE foo.log) -> log_trace_messages (TO_FILE foo.log).
2010-01-05-00.26.25: Pervasively renamed varptr -> current_thread_ptr assembly, C and Mythryl source.
2010-01-04-23.43.04: Pervasively renamed varptr -> current_thread_ptr assembly, C and Mythryl source.
2010-01-04-23.43.04: Pervasively renamed lib7_varReg -> lib7_current_thread.

2010-01-04-23.00.54: Pervasive renaming of GETVAR,SETVAR -> GET_CURRENT_THREAD_REGISTER,SET_CURRENT_THREAD_REGISTER.
2010-01-04-22.01.55: /src/lib/compiler/front/semantic/symbol-table/primitives-symbol-table.pkg: Renamed getvar,setvar -> get_current_thread_register,set_current_thread_register.
2010-01-04-21.11.49: src/lib/core/init/built-in.pkg: Renamed getvar,setvar -> get_current_thread_register,set_current_thread_register.

2010-01-04-17.35.21: src/lib/std/src/unsafe/unsafe.pkg: Renamed get_variable,set_variable -> get_current_thread_register,set_current_thread_register.
2010-01-03-16.17.38: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg:  Changed print_if to log name of traced thread.
2010-01-03-15.25.36: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/thread.pkg: Added name: String field to THREAD_ID record and name arg to make_thread. (Kids these days! When will they learn? :-)
2010-01-03-04.18.12: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.api: To make debug code prettier, changed print_if from (Trace_Tree_Node, (Void -> List(String)) -> Void; to Trace_Tree_Node -> (Void -> String) -> Void;.
2010-01-03-03.18.02: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/: Renamed thread-spy.pkg -> tracing.pkg (etc), since the remaining code now has a clear focus.
2010-01-03-02.59.28: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/: Split off part of thread-spy.pkg to create threadkit-uncaught-exception-reporting.pkg -- that code is unrelated to rest of package and did not belong in there.
2010-01-03-02.34.09: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/: Split off part of thread-spy.pkg to create thread-deathwatch.pkg -- that code is unrelated to rest of package and did not belong in there.
2010-01-03-02.01.30: src/lib/x-kit/lib/misc/xdebug.pkg: Renamed sel_tm -> selection_tracing etc, for clarity.
2010-01-03-01.26.45: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/thread-spy.api: Renamed trace -> print_if etc.
2010-01-03-00.40.00: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/thread-spy.api: Renamed watch,unwatch -> start_thread_deathwatch,stop_thread_deathwatch.
2010-01-03-00.22.54: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/thread.pkg: Renamed join_mailop -> thread_death_mailop.
2010-01-02-23.51.10: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/: Renamed threadkit-startup-and-shutdown.pkg -> threadkit-startup-and-shutdown-hooks.pkg etc.
2010-01-02-22.34.55: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/thread-spy.pkg: More renaming for clarity.
2010-01-02-18.49.13: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/thread-spy.pkg: More replacing of cryptonyms by identifiers.
2010-01-02-18.19.03: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/internal-threadkit-types.pkg: Removed 'alert' field from THREAD_ID record because it is nowhere used.
2010-01-02-16.57.01: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/: Rename threadkit-cleaup.pkg -> threadkit-startup-and-shutdown.pkg, etc.
2010-01-02-16.29.01: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/threadkit-cleanup.api: Random renaaming for clarity.
2010-01-02-15.05.49: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/: Rename trace-threadkit.pkg -> thread-spy.pkg.
2010-01-02-14.28.32: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/mailop.pkg: Rename kont -> fate.
2010-01-02-14.13.34: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/trace-threadkit.pkg: Minor low-level cleanup.
2010-01-02-02.12.17: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/widget-cable.pkg: Still more renaming for clarity.

2010-01-01-22.15.50: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/widget-cable.pkg: Renamed k,m,ci,co -> from_keyboard, from_mouse, from_mom, to_mom.
2010-01-01-19.57.53: src/lib/x-kit:  Rename winreg.pkg -> window-registry.pkg, screen_pt -> screen_point, but -> button ... 
2010-01-01-13.04.53: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/widget-cable.pkg: Rename Trans -> Transition, because the latter is an actual word.
2009-12-31-20.01.06: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed window-dictionary.pkg -> widget-cable.pkg, In_Env -> Kidplug, Out_Env -> Momplug etc.
2009-12-31-17.32.24: Pervasively renamed src,dst -> from,to -- because the Queen's English is not just for the Queen any more! :-)
2009-12-31-16.05.22: src/lib/x-kit/: Pervasively renamed rect to box because box is a vibrant, living word but rect is just the mutilated corpse of a pedanticism.
2009-12-31-05.05.10: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph-view/geometry-2d-float.pkg: Rename RPT -> POINT for clarity, etc.
2009-12-31-04.10.52: src/lib/x-kit/lib/user/geometry-2d.pkg: Pervasely rename rectangle to box for brevity.
2009-12-31-02.03.00: src/lib/x-kit/widgets/composite/: Renamed box.pkg -> layout-box.pkg.
2009-12-31-01.14.13: src/lib/x-kit/widgets/composite/: Renamed box-layout.pkg -> lay-out-boxes.pkg.
2009-12-31-00.56.40: src/lib/x-kit/widgets/basics/widget.pkg: Renamed incr -> step because the latter is a word and the former is not.
2009-12-30-21.58.26: src/lib/x-kit: Pervasively renamed macro_expand -> realize, undoing a long-ago global renamed aimed at compiler internals.
2009-12-30-21.58.26: src/lib/x-kit/lib/protocol/xrequest.pkg: Low-level cleanup.
2009-12-30-20.54.44: More mk_* -> make_* renaming. Remember, every time you abbreviate, God kills a kitten.
2009-12-30-20.20.52: More renaming of mk_* to make_*. Long live the Anti Word Vivisection Front! :-)
2009-12-30-19.56.22: Rename mk_ to make_ various places.
2009-12-30-15.20.24: Did global rename of *_rect to *_rectangle. (What is it with these creepy word mutilation cults? :-)
2009-12-30-04.03.31: src/lib/x-kit/lib/protocol/: Renamed keybut.pkg to keys-and-buttons.pkg.
2009-12-30-03.32.47: src/lib/x-kit/widgets/simple/scrollbar.pkg: Renamed SCREEN_* -> SCROLL_*.
2009-12-30-03.13.47: src/lib/x-kit/lib/user/geometry-2d.pkg: Renamed Rect,RECT -> Rectangle,RECTANGLE.
2009-12-30-01.07.10: src/lib/x-kit/lib/user/geometry-2d.pkg: Renamed y,x -> row,col because that is what they are.
2009-12-29-21.08.02: Renamed src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph-view/geometry-float.pkg -> src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph-view/geometry-2d-float.pkg.
2009-12-29-20.57.56: Renamed src/lib/x-kit/graph-util/rounded-rect.pkg -> src/lib/x-kit/graph-util/cartouche.pkg because that is the correct term.
2009-12-29-20.43.58: Removed src/lib/x-kit/lib/graph-util/* -- these files were all unused, redundant copies of files in src/lib/x-kit/graph-util/.
2009-12-29-20.30.18: Renamed src/lib/x-kit/lib/basics/geometry.pkg -> src/lib/x-kit/lib/user/geometry-2d.pkg.
2009-12-29-00.07.09: src/runtime/o/Makefile.in: $(RUNTIME): Add `pkg-config --libs gtk+-2.0` per Jeffrey Lau.
2009-12-28-23.30.35: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer: Now compiling and exercised by 'make rest' to keep it that way: main/main.pkg, graph-view/graph-view.pkg. (Basically all the examples/ml-viewer/ code is now compiling.)
2009-12-28-21.44.56: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/text-view: Renamed viewer.pkg -> ml-source-code-viewer.pkg.
2009-12-28-18.35.29: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer: Now compiling and exercised by 'make rest' to keep it that way: in util/: get-mouse-selection.pkg; in text-view/: text-display.pkg, approximate-ml.lex, scroll-viewer.pkg, viewer.pkg, text-canvas.pkg, view-buffer.pkg, load-file-g.pkg, ml-viewer.pkg; in graph-view/: graph-viewer.pkg. (That was a thrash!)
2009-12-24-19.31.02: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph-view: view-font.pkg and dotgraph-to-planargraph.pkg now compiling and exercised by 'make rest' to keep it that way.
2009-12-24-14.30.57: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph-view/planar-subgraph-tree.pkg: Now compiling and exercised by 'make rest' to keep it that way.
2009-12-24-11.54.33: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph: dot-graph.grammar, dot-graph.lex and dot-subgraph-tree.pkg now compile, and 'make rest' exercises them. (That was a thrash!)
2009-12-19-20.59.26: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph/dot-graph-io-g.pkg now compiles, and 'make rest' exercises it to make sure it stays compiling.
2009-12-19-20.15.40: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph/dot-graph.grammar now compiles, and 'make rest' exercises it to make sure it stays compiling.
2009-12-19-19.47.05: Renamed float::trunc to float::truncate, although there is a certain perverse irony in truncating the world truncate itself...
2009-12-19-19.32.33: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph-view/geometry-float.pkg now compiles, and 'make rest'' exercises it to make sure it stays compiling.
2009-12-19-19.02.30: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph/dot-subgraph-tree-attributes.pkg now compiles, and 'make rest' exercises it to make sure it stays compiling.
2009-12-19-18.50.30: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph/attributed-subgraph-tree-g.pkg now compiles, and 'make rest' exercises it to make sure it stays compiling.
2009-12-17-13.23.28: Got src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph/subgraph-tree-g.pkg to compile, partly by dint of rewriting it to use red-black trees instead of splaytrees. To keep it compiling, created a build-ml-viewer script and added it to 'make rest'. This means the complete ml-viewer example/app is maybe 5-10% of the way to compiling.
2009-12-15-10.18.35: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph-view/save/ and also all *.sav files under ml-viewer/.
2009-12-15-09.55.44: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/util/mlyacc-base.pkg -- how many copies of this do we need?
2009-12-14-18.37.06: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph/: Renamed attribute_graph* -> attributed_graph* per comments found in src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/GRAPHS.OVERVIEW.  Low-level cleanup on both .api and -g.pkg files.
2009-12-13-21.24.37: Low-level code cleanup throughout src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph/.
2009-12-13-18.44.47: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph/mlyacc-base.pkg -- another ml-yacc implementation file just floating around. Random cleanup in src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph/.
2009-12-13-13.47.45: Deleted entire src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/data/src/ directory, which appeared to contain primarily (only?) a redundant, unmaintained copy of ml-yacc.
2009-12-13-12.28.25: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/lib-base.pkg:  It was just an ancestral version of src/lib/src/lib-base.pkg.
2009-12-12-21.30.26: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/: Deleted static-array.api + lib-sg.pkg, both uninteresting scraps of dead code.
2009-12-12-21.20.09: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/string-covnersion.pkg:  Ancient implementations of atoi &tc -- stuff much better done these days using scanf or whatever.
2009-12-12-21.08.25: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/time-limit.pkg:  A 20-line package nowhere used whose functionality is subsumed by the threadkit timeout_in mailop and such.
2009-12-12-20.56.47: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/: Deleted unix-path.pkg + pathnamee.pkg: stdlib already has quite enough of this kind of functionality.
2009-12-12-20.46.02: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/makestring.pkg:  It provided simple formatting of ints and floats as strings, but newer packages like sfprintf do the same thing much better.
2009-12-12-20.33.33: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/hash-string.pkg:  A later version of the same code is available from src/lib/x-kit/lib/util/hash-util.pkg and the same functionality is available from src/lib/src/hash-string.pkg.
2009-12-12-20.20.23: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/: Deleted binary-dict.pkg + binary-set.pkg -- the same Stephen Adams binary tree code that stdlib already has in src/lib/src/binary-map-g.pkg, src/lib/src/binary-set-g.pkg &tc &tc.
2009-12-12-20.01.20: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/hash-table.pkg:  It was just an earlier version of src/lib/src/monomorphic-hash-table-g.pkg.
2009-12-12-19.49.28: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/poly-hash-table.pkg:  It was just an earlier version of src/lib/src/hash-table.pkg.
2009-12-12-18.52.13: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/: Deleted intset.pkg + intmap.pkg -- they were just ancestral versions of src/lib/src/int-binary-set.pkg + src/lib/src/int-binary-map.pkg.
