2011-10-10-12.18.04: src/lib/src/hashtable.api: make_hashtable: For clarity and consistency changed second arg from   (Int, Exception)   to   { size_hint: Int, not_found_exception: Exception }.   src/lib/compiler/back/low/treecode/rtl-props.api:  Fixed some accumulated bitrot.
2011-10-10-11.16.13: src/lib/std/src/nj/export.api (etc):  To make code more self-documenting added   Fork_Result = AM_PARENT | AM_CHILD;  and changed   fork_to_disk   from   String -> Bool   to   String -> Fork_Result.
2011-10-10-10.55.49: src/lib/core/internal/make-mythryld-executable.pkg:  Corrected alignment of compiletime console-narration output.
2011-10-10-10.43.27: src/c/main/load-compiledfiles.c: Corrected alignment of compiletime console-narration output.
2011-10-10-10.32.33: Minor commenting in make-sourcecode-for-backend-* and src/lib/compiler/back/low/*/*.architecture-description.
2011-10-09-21.41.15: src/lib/src/make-gtk-glue:  write_gtk_driver_c_set_callback_fun:  Changed   "GtkWidget* w0 ="   ->   "GtkWidget* w0 __attribute__((unused)) ="   to suppress some unused-variable warnings.   Makefile:  Added cheg: target to exercise gtk-glue, in the hope of avoiding future bitrot accumulation in that subsystem.  After five years, the C layer *finally* compiles warning-free at -Wall! :-) :-) :-)
2011-10-09-14.23.20: src/lib/src/make-gtk-glue: Fix two bitrots, in particular CFUNC was supplying 3 instead of 4 args. (fn name duplicated to ease changes).
2011-10-09-13.46.09: Fixed bitrot due to my not doing 'make gtk-glue' regularly:  src/lib/src/gtk-g.pkg: Changed imp::set -> int_map::set.  src/lib/src/make-gtk-glue: Changed list_mergesort::sort -> list_mergesort::sort_list and eight_bye_float -> eight_byte_float.
2011-10-08-22.28.02: src/c/lib/posix-os/tmpname.c: Rewrote to not use tmpnam(), which might be a bit better and suppresses a warning.  Created src/c/lib/posix-file-system/mkstemp.c, recommended as a more secure alternative, accessible via src/lib/std/src/posix-1003.1b/posix-file.pkg: UNTESTED.
2011-10-08-20.26.48: src/c/cleaner/mem-writer.c: Suppressed three compile warnings.
2011-10-08-20.13.12: src/c/cleaner/import-heap-stuff.c:  Suppressed two warnings by addingd missing <<return SUCCESS> in heapio__seek and casting strlen arg from Unt8* to> char*.
2011-10-08-20.02.44: src/c/lib/socket/hexdump-if.c:  Fixed a "implicit declaration of function isprint" warning by including <ctype.h>.

2011-10-08-19.28.26: src/c/lib/socket/get-or-set-boolean-socket-option.c:  Fixed "pointer targets in passing argument 5 of getsockopt differ in signedness" warning.
2011-10-08-19.15.16: src/c/cleaner/make-package-literals-via-bytecode-interpreter.c:  Suppressed "unused variable max_depth" warning.
2011-10-08-19.01.36: src/c/lib/socket/util-mkhostent.c: Suppressed four compiler warnings.
2011-10-08-18.39.14: src/c/cleaner/clean-n-agegroups.c:  Suppressed a "scan_memory_for_bogus_pointers declared static but never defined" compiler warning.
2011-10-08-18.28.36: src/c/cleaner/cleaner-initialization.c: Added proper #include files for write() and gettimeofday(); rewrote to pass arg of correct type to gettimeofday().
2011-10-08-17.55.17: For sanity, consistency, and the greater glory of Cthulhu:  Tweaked src/c/h/system-dependent-unix-stuff.h to no longer trigger "OS_NAME redefined" warnings;  tweaked src/c/h/architecture-and-os-names-system-dependent.h to generate OS_NAME values which are valid lower-case identifiers;  tweaked src/lib/std/src/nj/platform-properties.pkg to be consistent with the latter values.
2011-10-08-16.52.56: src/c/machine-dependent/posix-profiling-support.c: Changed  SET_SIGNAL_HANDLER( SIGVTALRM, SIG_DFL );  ->  SET_SIGNAL_HANDLER( SIGVTALRM, (void*)SIG_DFL )  to suppress a spurious "assignment from incompatible pointer type" warning.
2011-10-08-16.13.10: src/c/main/runtime-main.c: Conditionally included <unistd.h> to suppress implicit-declaration compiler warnings on functions 'close' and 'write'.
2011-10-08-02.01.57: src/lib/x-kit/widget/menu/popup-menu.pkg:  Suppressed nonexhaustive-match compiler warning.  That was the last one. :-)
2011-10-07-23.45.07: src/lib/compiler/back/low/tools/match-compiler/match-gen-g.pkg: Fixed nonexhaustive-match compiler warning (a real bug this time).
2011-10-07-22.45.30: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/pkg/window/keymap-imp.pkg:  Suppressed a nonexhaustive-match compiler warning.

2011-10-07-14.32.09: src/lib/x-kit/draw/spline.pkg: Suppressed nonexhaustive-match compiler warning.
2011-10-07-13.23.02: src/lib/compiler/back/low/tools/arch/adl-gen-ssaprops.pkg: Suppressed nonexhaustive-match compiler warning.
2011-10-07-13.01.15: src/lib/compiler/back/low/tools/arch/make-sourcecode-for-translate-machcode-to-asmcode-xxx-g-package.pkg: Suppressed nonexhaustive-match compiler warnings.
2011-10-07-12.25.45: src/lib/compiler/back/low/tools/arch/adl-typing.pkg: Suppressed a nonexhaustive-match compiler warning.
2011-10-07-11.59.58: Try II: src/lib/compiler/back/low/tools/arch/architecture-description.pkg: Suppressed a nonexhaustive-match compiler warning.
2011-10-07-11.47.32: src/lib/compiler/back/low/tools/arch/architecture-description.pkg: Suppressed a nonexhaustive-match compiler warning.

2011-10-07-11.34.25: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/mailop.pkg: Suppressed a nonexhaustive-match compiler warning. 'make compiler' now compiles warning-free at the Mythryl level.
2011-10-07-11.17.52: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/thread-scheduler.pkg:  Suppressed a nonexhaustive-match compiler warning.
2011-10-07-10.59.39: src/lib/compiler/back/low/pwrpc32/pwrpc32.architecture-description: Suppressed four nonexhaustive-match compiler warnings that manifested in src/lib/compiler/back/low/pwrpc32/emit/translate-machcode-to-execode-pwrpc32-g.codemade.pkg.

2011-10-06-21.15.48: src/lib/compiler/back/low/tools/parser/architecture-description-language.grammar: Suppressed a couple of nonexhaustive-match compiler warnings.
2011-10-06-21.04.16: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/oneshot-maildrop.pkg: Tidying, suppressed a nonexhaustive-match compiler warning.
2011-10-06-15.56.25: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/threadkit-io-manager.pkg: Suppressed nonexhaustive-match compiler warning.
2011-10-06-15.56.25: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/maildrop.pkg: Suppressed a nonexhaustive-match compiler warning.
2011-10-06-15.40.42: src/lib/compiler/back/low/tools/adl-syntax/adl-raw-syntax-unparser.pkg: Suppressed two more nonexhaustive-match compiler warnings.
2011-10-06-14.48.12: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/mailqueue.pkg: Suppressed another nonexhaustive-match compiler warning.
2011-10-06-14.34.38: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/mailqueue.pkg: Tidying.
2011-10-06-13.20.35: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/mailqueue.pkg: Suppressed a nonexhaustive-match warning.
2011-10-06-13.09.53: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/thread-scheduler.pkg: Tidying.
2011-10-06-12.54.51: Try II: src/lib/std/src/: For clarity and consistency, renamed exceptions.api -> exceptions-guts.api, and internally renamed api Pre_Exceptions -> Exceptions_Guts.
2011-10-06-12.45.44: src/lib/std/src/: For clarity and consistency, renamed exceptions.api -> exceptions-guts.api, and internally renamed api Pre_Exceptions -> Exceptions_Guts.
2011-10-06-12.45.44: Established src/lib/std/exceptions.api, extracting its contents from the bottom of src/lib/std/src/exceptions.api.
2011-10-06-12.35.59: Renamed src/lib/std/src/exceptions.pkg -> src/lib/std/src/exceptions-guts.pkg for consistency and to distinguish it clearly from src/lib/std/exceptions.pkg.
2011-10-02-20.28.46: src/lib/: renamed controls/ -> global-controls/ and within it control* -> global-control*, as a first step toward eventually getting rid of them completely.  Every one of these is a global variable, and every global variable is a roadblock on the way to concurrent programming in Mythryl.
2011-10-02-14.11.38: src/lib/compiler/toplevel/main/: Renamed controls.api -> global-controls.api, controls.pkg -> global-controls.pkg, partly for clarity, partly to free up those names for an eventual local-controls (i.e., pure-functional red-black-tree-based) package.
2011-10-01-06.24.47: Minor tidying.
2011-10-01-06.01.04: src/lib/core/internal/mythryl-compiler-version.pkg: Advanced version to 5.3.0 because Parallel Compiles (Take Two) seems to be working.
2011-10-01-03.25.04: src/lib/std/src/posix/spawn.api: Added support for (REDIRECT_STDERR_TO_STDOUT_IN_CHILD  Bool) option to spawn_process{} and fork_process{}.
2011-10-01-02.56.21: src/lib/std/src/posix/spawn.api: Thoroughly reworked this API along the lines suggested by Joe Wells.
2011-09-30-13.40.36: For clarity:  src/lib/std/src/posix-1003.1b/posix-file.api: Renamed make_pipe -> make_named_pipe. src/lib/std/src/posix-1003.1b/posix-io.api: Renamed pipe -> make_pipe.
2011-09-30-03.38.47: Dropped the old remote-compile stuff because 1) It never worked; 2) I cannot forsee much if any practical use for it. 3) It complicates the code. 4) The new fork()-ing based parallel compilation mechanism is simpler and much more useful in practice.  This involved removing:  src/app/makelib/concurrency/dummy-makelib-client.pkg, src/app/makelib/concurrency/makelib-client-queen.api, src/app/makelib/concurrency/makelib-client-queen.pkg, src/app/makelib/main/makelib-server.pkg and all refernces to them.  Yay!!
2011-09-29-22.33.05: src/lib/std/src/posix/spawn.api: From common decency renamed txt_instream_of -> get_text_input_stream_from etc.  Every time you mutilate a word, God kills a kitten.  Think of the kittens.
2011-09-29-19.41.12: src/app/makelib/compile/compile-in-dependency-order-g.pkg: Parallel compiles working. src/lib/core/internal/mythryl-compiler-version.pkg: Advanced to 5.2.0 in honor of previous.
2011-09-29-04.01.40: src/lib/std/src/posix/spawn.api: To simplify the api and close a race-condition window, changed process_id_of type from  Process(X,Y) -> Null_Or(Int)  to   Process(X,Y) -> Int.   src/lib/std/src/posix/spawn.pkg: To implement previous, changed Process_Status to remember the process_id of DEAD processes.
2011-09-29-03.26.31: src/lib/std/src/posix/spawn.api: For clarity, renamed pid_of -> process_id_of. Clarify globally, abbreviate locally.
2011-09-28-03.41.11: src/c/lib/posix-os/poll.c: This was segfaulting due to basically doing  if (ptr==NULL) foo=*ptr. Fixed. This was my fault; the ancestral SML/NJ 110.58 was correct.
2011-09-27-21.46.01: src/c/lib/socket/: Added to-log.c to give Mythryl-level access to log-if.c
2011-09-27-12.55.22: Add a paragraph to src/A.LOGGER.OVERVIEW.
2011-09-27-00.42.12: Bumped version number to 5.1.0 in honor of previous check-in.
2011-09-26-23.11.45: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/logger.pkg: Rationalized and coordinated C-level, monothread-mythryl and multithread-mythryl logging by moving much of the guts of logger.pkg into src/lib/std/src/io/file-g.pkg, making the calls at all three levels more alike and adding logging of pid to the line format.
2011-09-26-03.37.27: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/logger.pkg: Tidying.
2011-09-26-01.10.22: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/: For clarity renamed tracing.api -> logger.api, tracing.pkg -> logger.pkg.  src/lib/x-kit/xclient/pkg/stuff/: For clarity and consistency renamed xtracing.pkg -> xlogger.pkg
2011-09-25-02.03.37: src/lib/std/src/posix/spawn.api: Added pid_of call.
2011-09-24-16.59.03: src/app/makelib/compile/compile-in-dependency-order-g.pkg: Located and marked proper spot to fork() off compile subprocesses.
2011-09-24-13.03.57: src/app/makelib/concurrency/makelib-thread-queen.pkg: Added cores_in_use and core_wait_queue to Makelib_Thread_Queen state record, as a first step toward supporting multicore compiles via fork().
2011-09-24-12.24.19: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/winix/threadkit-winix-io.api: For clarity and consistency, renamed 'poll' -> 'wait_for_io_opportunity' and 'poll_mailop' -> 'wait_for_io_opportunity_mailop'. Pervasively: Added 'select' as a deprecated synonym for 'wait_for_io_opportunity', so that unix folks looking for 'select' in the function index will get led to the right spots.
2011-09-24-12.00.21: Lots of stuff. src/lib/std/src/winix/winix-io.api: Renamed poll_io_descriptors -> wait_for_io_opportunity (etc) because the whole point is that it does not poll, it blocks. src/app/makelib/concurrency/makelib-thread.pkg: Eliminated global variables by introducing a Makelib_Thread_Queen state record; renamed package to makelib-thread-queen.pkg.  Similarly eliminated global variables from makelib-client.pkg and renamed to makelib-client-queen.pkg.
2011-09-23-22.54.43: src/app/makelib/concurrency/: Renamed makelib-thread.pkg -> makelib-thread-boss.pkg as first step to elimating the package's global variables.
2011-09-23-14.40.43: src/lib/std/src/posix/spawn.pkg: Factored fork_process' out of spawn_process_in_environment, then added a new fork_process call (which I need for compile-in-dependency-order-g.pkg work.)
2011-09-23-02.59.17: src/lib/std/src/unix/spawn.api: Reversing edit of 2010-09-11-11.29.22, renamed process -> spawn_process and process_in_environment -> spawn_process_in_environment because I've standardized on not considering the package name part of a function name (package might get renamed at point of use -- by current programming protocol, will always be renamed at point of use).
2011-09-22-19.17.26: src/app/makelib/compile/compile-in-dependency-order-g.pkg: Tidying.
2011-09-21-14.36.41: src/app/makelib/concurrency/makelib-thread.pkg: Replaced make_unix_pipe_input_wait_queue with new read_line_from_unix_pipe fn -- this is a more natural unit of functionality which streamlines the client-end code.
2011-09-21-14.07.30: src/app/makelib/concurrency/makelib-thread.pkg: For clarity, renamed spawn_stream_proxy_thread -> make_unix_pipe_input_wait_queue.
2011-09-21-13.52.37: src/app/makelib/main/: For clarity and accuracy, renamed compile-server.pkg -> makelib-server.pkg.  src/app/makelib/concurrency/: Similarly renamed compile-client.api -> makelib-client.api, renamed compile-client.pkg -> makelib-client.pkg, dummy-compile-client.pkg -> dummy-makelib-client.pkg.
2011-09-21-11.35.33: app/makelib/simple-concurrency/: Renamed simple-concurrency.sublib -> makelib-concurrency.sublib for consistency with previous.
2011-09-21-11.25.51: app/makelib/simple-concurrency/: Renamed simple-thread.pkg -> makelib-thread.pkg because it is a dedicated package neither intended nor suitable for use outside of makelib.
2011-09-21-05.13.02: src/app/makelib/simple-concurrency/compile-client.pkg: Random cleaning.
2011-09-21-04.51.00: src/lib/std/src/winix/winix-io.api: For clarity, renamed poll(poll_requests,timeout) -> poll_io_descriptors { poll_requests, timeout }.
2011-09-20-22.32.24: src/app/makelib/compile/compile-in-dependency-order-g.pkg: Tidying.
2011-09-18-23.44.06: For clarity pervasively renamed filesys -> file-system.
2011-09-18-23.17.06: For clarity, renamed src/c/lib/posix-procenv -> src/c/lib/posix-process-environment.
2011-09-18-23.05.47: src/app/makelib/compile/compile-in-dependency-order-g.pkg: Cleaning, commenting and clarifying.
2011-09-18-15.37.15: Renamed graphwalk to dagwalk everywhere for accuracy and brevity, and because it is more euphonious.
2011-09-18-14.37.32: src/lib/core/internal/mythryl-compiler-version.pkg: Belatedly bumped version to 5.0.1 in honor of answer_42's bugfix.
2011-09-18-12.50.31: sh/_guess-host-architecture-and-os: Backpatched answer_42's (via Michele Bini) "3.0.*) ;;" fix for x86 Linux kernel 3.0.x support.
2011-09-18-01.19.50: src/lib/std/src/list.api:  Added new map' and apply' (reverse arg order from map and apply) from src/lib/core/init/pervasive.pkg.
2011-09-18-01.10.22: src/lib/std/src/list.api: For clarity renamed map' -> map_partial_fn.  src/lib/core/init/pervasive.pkg: Added map' x f = map f x, apply' x f = apply f x.
2011-09-17-13.41.33: 5.0.0 release.
2011-09-17-04.08.10: src/app/benchmarks/:  Added tagged-int-shellsort-no-bounds-checking.pkg -- more than twice as fast as tagged-int-shellsort.pkg.
2011-09-17-03.56.22: src/app/benchmarks/tagged-int-shellsort.pkg: Implemented.
2011-09-17-03.29.01: src/app/benchmarks/: Established dummy tagged-int-shellsort.pkg benchmark.
2011-09-17-03.11.42: src/lib/compiler/back/top/translate/translate-deep-syntax-to-lambdacode.pkg: Implemented compiler::check_vector_index_bounds control.
2011-09-17-02.35.06: src/lib/compiler/toplevel/main/compiler-controls.pkg:  Added compiler::check_vector_index_bounds control. (Does nothing yet.)
2011-09-17-00.08.37: src/lib/compiler/toplevel/main/: Renamed backend-controls.pkg -> compiler-controls.pkg and thus backend::trap_int_overflow -> compiler::trap_int_overflow (etc), to be less confusing the the application programmer.
2011-09-16-02.36.52: src/lib/compiler/toplevel/main/backend-controls.pkg: trap_int_overflow now defaults to FALSE.
2011-09-16-00.36.25: src/lib/compiler/back/low/main/main/translate-nextcode-to-treecode-g.pkg: Tweaked to generate overflow-trapping ops (*_OR_TRAP) only if  *bec::trap_int_overflow  is  TRUE.
2011-09-15-23.56.25: src/lib/compiler/back/low/treecode/treecode-form.api:  For clarity, renamed NEGT -> NEG_OR_TRAP, ADDT -> ADD_OR_TRAP, SUBT -> SUB_OR_TRAP, MULT -> MULS_OR_TRAP, DIVT -> DIVS_OR_TRAP. (These are the arithmetic-overflow-trapping versions of NEG/ADD/SUB/MULS/DIVS respectively.  There is no REM_OR_TRAP because the remainder op never overflows.)
2011-09-15-23.43.41: src/lib/compiler/toplevel/main/backend-controls.pkg: Did a clone-and-hack with insufficient hack and backend::trap_int_overflow wound up named "verbose_compile_log", oops. Fixed.
2011-09-15-21.58.24: In all files using OVERFLOW, added the line   #DO set_control "backend::trap_int_overflow" "TRUE";
2011-09-15-15.05.34: src/lib/compiler/toplevel/main/backend-controls.pkg: Added   backend::trap_int_overflow   control. (Does nothing as yet.)
2011-09-15-13.21.21: src/lib/compiler/toplevel/main/backend-controls.pkg: Added backend::verbose_compile_log control; now to get verbose compile logs you can just put <<#DO set_control "backend::verbose_compile_log" "TRUE";>> at the top of the file, instead of having to edit fun do_verbose_logging_for in src/app/makelib/compile/compile-in-dependency-order-g.pkg and recompile the compiler.
2011-09-15-13.01.35: #DO code evaluation no longer echoed to stdout -- was cluttering the compiler console narration.
2011-09-15-02.09.35: Benchmark code tweaking.
2011-09-14-19.34.12: src/app/benchmarks/:  Did a clone-and-mutate on   tagged-int-loop.pkg  to produce a second benchmark,  src/app/benchmarks/one-word-int-loop.pkg.
2011-09-14-19.16.02: src/lib/std/src/cpu-timer.api:  For clarity, changed gc -> heapcleaner and nongc -> program throughout.
2011-09-14-18.34.12: src/lib/std/src/cpu-timer.api: Renamed everything for clarity, changed value types from time::Time to Float for convenience.
2011-09-14-15.29.31: src/lib/std/src/time.api: For clarity and to proactively reduce the probability of obscure bugs, renamed  to_float -> to_float_seconds  and  from_float -> from_float_seconds.
2011-09-14-14.40.44: Added src/app/benchmarks/tagged-int-loop.pkg benchmark, got it to compile and run.
2011-09-14-14.12.39: src/lib/std/src/cpu-timer.api: Added Cpu_Times type as a convenience for client packages.
2011-09-14-12.41.07: Zeroth-order   "make benchmarks"   framework compiles and runs.
2011-09-14-12.32.51: Renamed  src/app/benchmark/ -> src/app/benchmarks/  because I keep typing it in that way anyhow.
2011-09-14-12.15.36: Cloned  "make check"  to produce a zeroth-order  "make benchmarks".
2011-09-14-00.36.21: Downloaded a 1996 Xavier Leroy smlnj benchmark set and saved it in new directory src/app/benchmark/ for eventual translation into Mythryl.
2011-09-14-00.15.52: Try 2: src/lib/controls/control-forms.pkg: Renamed  Priority -> Menu_Rank (etc) because that is what it in fact is.  src/lib/src/list-mergesort.pkg: For clarity renamed sort -> sort_list, sorted -> list_is_sorted, unique_sort -> sort_list_and_drop_duplicates.
2011-09-14-00.07.24: src/lib/controls/control-forms.pkg: Renamed  Priority -> Menu_Rank (etc) because that is what it in fact is.  src/lib/src/list-mergesort.pkg: For clarity renamed sort -> sort_list, sorted -> list_is_sorted, unique_sort -> sort_list_and_drop_duplicates.
2011-09-14-00.07.24: src/lib/controls/control-forms.pkg: Renamed  Priority -> Menu_Rank (etc) because that is what it in fact is.  src/lib/src/list-mergesort.pkg: For clarity renamed sort -> sort_list, sorted -> list_is_sorted, unique_sort -> sort_list_and_drop_duplicates.
2011-09-13-21.23.33: src/lib/controls/: Renamed  control-reps.pkg -> control-forms.pkg because every time we mutilate a word, God kills a kitten.  Think of the kittens.
2011-09-13-20.48.49: src/lib/compiler/toplevel/main/: Renamed  backend-lowhalf-controls.pkg -> backend-controls.pkg  because they are used throughout the backend.
2011-09-13-12.09.40: sh/make-install: patch -p1 in DESTDIR support. Thanks to Michele Bini for contributing this, not to mention Debianizing the whole Mythryl distribution!
2011-09-13-01.24.43: #DO now working to a first approximation.
2011-09-11-17.35.33: Random tidying, mostly changing instances of Sourcecode_Info to be named sourcecode_info.
2011-09-11-14.04.38: src/lib/compiler/front/parser/raw-syntax/raw-syntax.pkg:  Added PRE_COMPILE_CODE(String) to Declaration.
2011-09-11-13.05.06: Zeroth-order src/lib/compiler/front/parser/lex/mythryl.lex pre_compile_code support:  #DO foo bar<eol>  functions as a comment.
2011-09-11-02.19.13: Much cleaning centering on src/lib/compiler/front/basics/stats/compile-statistics.pkg; Added new tokens PRE_COMPILE_CODE and POSTCOMPILE_CODE in src/lib/compiler/front/parser/yacc/mythryl.grammar.
2011-09-10-03.00.11: Moved memoize.pkg from src/app/makelib/stuff/ to src/lib/std/ because it is generally useful, not compiler-specific.
2011-09-10-02.03.50: src/lib/compiler/front/basics/print/: Renamed printcontrol.pkg -> control-print.pkg because in fact it contained package control_print and api Control_Print.
2011-09-08-05.34.53: src/lib/compiler/front/basics/source/: Renamed source-code-source -> sourcecode-info.pkg for clarity, much random cleaning.

2011-09-08-03.09.46: test
2011-09-06-04.12.17: test
2011-09-06-04.12.17: 4.2.0 release: More renaming of number and vector packages.
2011-09-03-07.04.37: Random tidying centering on src/lib/core/init/built-in.pkg.
2011-09-03-05.11.18: Pervasively renamed intinf -> integer for clarity and because it has indefinite precision, never infinite precision.
2011-09-03-04.49.03: Pervasively renamed int64 -> int2 (2-word int) so as to be agnostic between 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. (Int2 will be 64 bits on 32-bit architectures, 128 bits on 64-bit architectures.)
2011-09-03-04.28.53: Pervasively renamed unt64 -> unt2 (2-word unt) so as to be agnostic between 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. (Unt2 will be 64 bits on 32-bit architectures, 128 bits on 64-bit architectures.)
2011-09-03-03.55.52: Pervasively renamed unt32 -> unt1 (1-word unt) so as to be agnostic between 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. (Unt1 will be 32 bits on 32-bit architectures, 64 bits on 64-bit architectures.)
2011-09-03-02.48.57: Pervasively renamed int32 -> int1 (1-word int) so as to be agnostic between 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. (Int1 will be 32 bits on 32-bit architectures, 64 bits on 64-bit architectures.)
2011-09-03-01.46.18: Pervasively renamed int31 -> tagged_int so as to be agnostic between 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. (Tagged ints will be 63 bits long on 64-bit architectures.)
2011-09-01-13.02.00: Switching on pass-runtime reporting via show_compile_phase_runtimes_for make-nextcode-closures-g.pkg in src/app/makelib/compile/compile-dependency-graph-walk-g.pkg appeared to trigger a heap-corruption Heisenbug...? Gone for the moment.
2011-08-29-22.26.43: Standardized on 'err' (vs 'em') as abbreviation for package error_message.
2011-08-29-16.58.23: Cleaning and commenting centered on  src/lib/compiler/toplevel/interact/compiler-state.pkg
2011-08-29-13.58.42: More cleaning and commenting centering on src/app/makelib/compile/compile-dependency-graph-walk-g.pkg

2011-08-28-13.28.28: Cosmetics like changing  Foo( X )  ->  Foo(X)  for better readability.
2011-08-25-03.47.36: Much commenting, renaming and clarifying centering on src/lib/compiler/back/top/nextcode/nextcode-form.api, which is now largely decoded.
2011-08-22-01.32.36: src/lib/compiler/back/top/nextcode/nextcode-form.api: For clarity, renamed 'codetemp' fields to 'to_temp'.
2011-08-21-15.06.41: src/lib/compiler/back/top/closures/make-nextcode-closures-g.pkg: Changed CLOSURE_REP from tuple to record.
2011-08-21-13.15.45: Random commenting centering on src/lib/compiler/back/low/main/main/translate-nextcode-to-treecode-g.pkg
2011-08-19-04.57.16: src/lib/compiler/back/top/nextcode/nextcode-form.api: For clarity, pervasively renamed name -> codetemp.
2011-08-18-17.24.10: More fatecode -> nextcode renaming stuff.
2011-08-18-13.47.23: Try 2: Pervasively renamed fatecode -> nextcode because foo.next is clearer than foo.fate.
2011-08-10-05.12.18: Pervasively renamed fatecode -> nextcode because foo.next is clearer than foo.fate.
2011-08-14-02.09.01: Random commenting and cleaning centering on   src/lib/compiler/back/low/main/main/translate-fatecode-to-treecode-g.pkg. Pervasively renamed codestream -> codebuffer.
2011-08-13-00.33.43: src/lib/compiler/back/low/main/fatecode/emit-treecode-heapcleaner-calls-g.pkg: Decoding and commenting basically complete.
2011-08-10-05.11.51: src/lib/compiler/back/low/main/fatecode/: For clarity renamed insert-treecode-heapcleaner-calls.api -> emit-treecode-heapcleaner-calls.api, insert-treecode-heapcleaner-calls-g.pkg -> emit-treecode-heapcleaner-calls-g.pkg; Much commenting in latter.
2011-08-10-05.12.18: src/lib/compiler/back/low/main/fatecode/: For clarity renamed insert-treecode-heapcleaner-calls.api -> emit-treecode-heapcleaner-calls.api, insert-treecode-heapcleaner-calls-g.pkg -> emit-treecode-heapcleaner-calls-g.pkg; Much commenting in latter.
2011-08-08-13.39.22: Pervasively renamed all_callers_known -> private.  Appels known/escape/cont fn trichotomy terminology is terrible; private/public/fate seems the best replacement.
2011-08-07-23.46.40: src/lib/compiler/back/low/main/fatecode/insert-treecode-heapcleaner-calls-g.pkg: Improved typesafety by splitting Heapcleaner_Call into Heapcleaner_Call + Longjump_To_Heapcleaner_Call.
2011-08-07-16.11.08: src/lib/compiler/back/low/main/fatecode/insert-treecode-heapcleaner-calls-g.pkg: Random cleaning and commenting.
2011-08-06-01.37.11: src/lib/std/src/list.api: For clarity, renamed take -> take_n, drop -> drop_n.
2011-08-06-00.33.24: Random cleaning and commenting.  src/lib/std/src/io/file.api: Change attribution from Jeffrey Lau to Michele Bini per post from former.
2011-08-04-02.02.50: 4.0.0 release, try 3.
2011-08-04-02.02.50: 4.0.0 release, try 2.
2011-08-04-00.23.13: 4.0.0 release.
2011-07-23-02.40.36: First clean build of release-4 docs. :-)
2011-07-19-20.25.02: Renamed generic_socket -> plain_socket etc to avoid confusion with technical meaning of generic -- and because briefer is better when clarity holds constant! :-)
2011-07-12-02.16.51: Got time-profiling working again! :-)  Documented in src/A.TRACE-DEBUG-PROFILE.OVERVIEW. Biggest glitch was that I had renamed subscript -> get in core.pkg but not add-per-fun-call-counters-to-deep-syntax.pkg.
2011-07-04-14.18.38: For clarity, renamed abscode (abstract machine code) -> machcode (abstract machine code :-)
2011-07-03-03.45.41: src/lib/src/typelocked-hashtable.api: For clarity, changed from  make_hashtable (32, FOO)  ->  make_hashtable { size_hint => 32, not_found_exception => FOO }.  (Ye godz there are a lot of hashtables in the codebase!)
2011-06-28-00.40.16: For clarity and consistency (and England and St George!) renamed src/lib/src/union-find.pkg -> src/lib/src/disjoint-sets-with-constant-time-union.pkg
2011-06-21-00.48.03: Renamed bitmatrix{api,pkg} -> graph-by-edge-hashtable{api,pkg}, because that is what it turned out to be, on closer inspection.
2011-06-20-21.39.00: For clarity and consistency, renamed make_table -> make_hashtable in all hashtable implementations.
2011-06-20-21.22.29: For consistency, conciseness and clarity, globally renamed hash_table -> hashtable, hash-table -> hashtable etc.
2011-06-20-20.35.01: Renamed src/lib/compiler/back/low/regor/regor-bitmatrix.{api,pkg} -> src/lib/std/src/bitmatrix.{api,pkg} because there is nothing remotely compiler-specific about it -- it is just a bitmatrix implementation.
2011-06-20-15.12.45: priority-queue.api: For consistency and clarity, renamed create -> make_priority_queue and create_n to make_priority_queue'.
2011-06-13-18.14.55: For conciseness and consistency, renamed src/lib/graph/oop-directed-graph.api -> src/lib/graph/oop-digraph.api.
2011-06-13-18.14.55: For clarity, conciseness, consistency and futureproofing, renamed src/lib/graph/directed-graph.pkg -> src/lib/graph/digraph-by-adjacency-list.pkg,  src/lib/graph/directed-graph-g.pkg -> src/lib/graph/digraph-by-adjacency-list-g.pkg.
2011-06-12-00.34.29: Renamed src/lib/graph/isograph.pkg -> mapped-digraph-view.pkg
2011-06-12-00.17.54: Moved src/lib/compiler/back/low/library/bitset.pkg src/lib/graph/bit-set.pkg, src/lib/compiler/back/low/library/bitset.api src/lib/graph/bit-set.api because they are used by other src/lib/graph/* packages.
2011-06-12-00.17.54: For clarity, renamed src/lib/graph/graph.api -> src/lib/graph/oop-directed-graph.api, src/lib/graph/graph.pkg -> src/lib/graph/oop-directed-graph.pkg
2011-06-09-02.03.20: Similarly pervasively replaced "polymorphic" with "typeagnostic".
2011-06-09-00.06.47: Finally lost it and globally renamed "monomorphic" to "typelocked". "Monomorphic" is a hideous polysyllabic academic obscurantism whose relevant meaning remains a mystery even when translated from Greek into Latin ("uniform") or English ("one-shaped").
2010-11-20-00.06.42: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-gtk/gtk-driver.c: _lib7_Gtk_gtk_init: Fixed: argc was being used uninitialized, which was segfaulting us. *BLUSH*!!
2010-11-16-13.53.28: Finished codepass converting /* ... */ -> // ... in (most) of the C code.
2010-11-16-02.49.10: More hours of changing /* ... */ -> // ... in the C code...
2010-11-15-23.09.58: src/runtime/heapcleaner/: import-heap.c export-heap.c:  More gcc -Wall driven tweaks.
2010-11-15-22.28.15: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/: recvbuffrom.c, recvfrom.c:  Two more gcc -Wall inspired fixes.
2010-11-15-21.44.57: src/runtime/heapcleaner/clean-full-heap.c:  clean_n_heap_generations: gcc -Wall warns promote_state may be used uninitialized.  Initialized it arbitrarily. There may be an actual bug here.
2010-11-15-20.47.20: src/runtime/heapcleaner/: clean-subheap.c, clean-full-heap.c:  Suppressed more harmless gcc -Wall warnings.
2010-11-15-20.33.11: src/runtime/c-libs/posix-io/lseek_64.c:  Suppressed another harmless gcc -Wall warning.
2010-11-15-20.10.46: src/runtime/c-libs/posix-io/fcntl_l_64.c: Suppressed three more harmless gcc -Wall warnings.
2010-11-15-19.05.47: src/runtime/c-libs/posix-filesys/stat_64.c: Fixed a (harmless) gcc -Wall warning.
2010-11-15-15.54.09: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-opencv/cvLoadImage.c: gcc -Wall caught me confusing 'image' (a Mythryl-heap val) with 'ipl_image' (a C-heap val). *blush*!  Fixed.
2010-11-15-15.31.25: Another four hours or so of converting C /* ... */ comments to // comments, with incidental passing-through tidying.
2010-11-15-02.06.09: gcc -Wall complained that ctlLINGER.c ctlNODELAY.c ctlRCVBUF.c exit.c ctlSNDBUF.c getERROR.c getTYPE.c getpeername.c getsockname.c accept.c were using an int where a socklen_t was required.  Fixed.
2010-11-14-19.34.16: Changed c89 /* ... */ comments to c99 // comments many places in the C code.
2010-11-13-22.15.36: Added -std=c99 -Wall to CFLAGS everywhere.  Because Its Time, as the BITNET folks used to say...
2010-11-11-11.36.28: src/runtime/include/: Renamed virtual-processor-state.h -> pthread.h.
2010-11-10-16.12.01: src/runtime/heapcleaner/: For clarity and consistency, renamed call-gc. -> call-heapcleaner.c, init-gc.c -> heapcleaner-initialization.c.
2010-11-10-15.29.40: For clarity, renamed src/runtime/gc/ -> src/runtime/heapcleaner.
2010-11-10-15.07.42: In the C runtimes, for consistency and clarity, pervasively renamed lib7_state_t -> Task and lib7_state -> task.
2010-11-10-14.29.56: src/runtime/include/runtime-base.h: For clarity and consistency, renamed Word_t -> Val_Sized_Unt (etc).  src/lib/std/src/nj/: For clarity, renamed signals.api -> runtime-signals.api (etc).
2010-11-10-12.52.34: Much cleaning in and around the C garbage collector, including favoring heapcleaner for a name for conciseness and renaming lib7_val_t to Val to reduce clutter.
2010-11-09-22.24.21: src/runtime/include/: Renamed vproc-state.h -> virtual-processor-state.h, and dropped vp_ prefix from field names.
2010-11-09-20.44.18: src/runtime/include/runtime-state.h: struct lib7_state: Eliminated lib7_ prefixes on fieldnames -- fieldname prefixes have not been needed in C since the BDS C days.
2010-11-09-14.37.08: For clarity, renamed src/runtime/include/runtime-mp.h -> src/runtime/include/runtime-multicore.h  and  src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-mp/liblib7-mp.c src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-multicore/liblib7-multicore.c
2010-11-09-14.18.59: src/runtime/: For clarity, renamed mp/ -> multicore/.
2010-11-09-13.12.13: src/runtime: For clarity, pervasively renamed MP_SUPPORT -> MULTICORE_SUPPORT etc. (Why cannot people just say what they mean? :-)
2010-11-07-14.07.45: For clarity, pervasively replaced assembly::foo with runtime::foo. (Very little of the runtime is in assembly.)
2010-11-06-01.45.05: For clarity, pervasively renamed p_struct and pstruct to pervasive_package_pickle_list.
2010-11-05-22.49.06: src/lib/core/internal/: Merged make-mythryl-compiler-etc-g.pkg into make-mythryl-compiler-etc.pkg:  The package no longer needs to be generic.
2010-11-04-23.05.28: src/lib/core/internal/make-mythryl-compiler-etc-g.pkg: make_mythryl_compiler_etc: To reduce code clutter, dropped support for --runtime-heap, making it instead a constant mythryld_executable_filename_to_create (== mythryld) in app/makelib/mythryl-compiler-compiler/mythryl-compiler-compiler-configuration.pkg.
2010-11-04-21.39.16: src/lib/compiler/backend/lower-half/tools/nowhere/: For clarity, renamed build -> build-nowhere-app.
2010-11-03-23.33.26: src/etc/: For clarity, renamed root.lib -> mythryl-compiler-root.lib.
2010-11-03-20.34.22: For typesafety, pervasively replaced (architecture_name: String) with (machine_architecture: sma::Supported_Machine_Architectures).
2010-11-03-12.46.03: Created src/lib/compiler/frontend/basics/main/supported-machine-architectures.pkg to provide typesafe machine architecture identification. (SML/NJ just uses strings -- bleah!)
2010-11-03-11.53.48: src/lib/core/internal/make-mythryl-compiler-etc-g.pkg: Dropped now-unneeded make_compiler generic arg.
2010-11-03-11.27.26: src/lib/core/internal/make-mythryl-compiler-etc-g.pkg: To reduce code clutter, dropped support for unused switches --runtime-bare, --runtime-rebuild, --runtime-lightrebuild.
2010-11-02-12.27.48: src/app/burg/: For clarity, renamed mythryl-burg -> mythryl-burg-fraser-hanson-proebsting-92-optimal-tree-rewriter.pkg (etc).  src/lib/core/internal/: For better factoring, created mythryld.pkg + mythryld.api
2010-11-01-15.23.25: src/lib/core/internal/: For clarity and conciseness, renamed build-mythryld-heap-image.pkg -> make-mythryld-executable.pkg.  Also renamed src/app/makelib/mythryl-compiler-compiler/A_COMPILE_COMPILER.OVERVIEW -> src/A.MAKE_COMPILER.INTERNALS.OVERVIEW.
2010-11-01-14.43.06: For consistency, renamed foo.pkg -> foo-g.pkg for a wearisome number of foo.  src/app/makelib/semant/: For clarity, renamed version.pkg -> makelib-version.pkg
2010-11-01-02.41.30: For consistency, renamed ia32*lib -> x86*lib.
2010-11-01-02.31.22: For clarity, pervasively renamed source-map -> line-number-db.
2010-10-31-17.42.56: Converted left-over o7/O7 references to dotcompiled/Dotcompiled.
2010-10-31-14.45.52: doc/tex/sh/: Tweaked make-comments and synthesize-sourcecode-latex-docs to (maybe) support .sublib as well as .lib files. (Untested.)
2010-10-31-11.59.16: For clarity, changed from real vs virtual library terminlogy to main- vs sub-library terminology. The former is mysterious, the latter is self-explanatory.
2010-10-30-20.17.02: For clarity, pervasively renamed sublibraries from foo.lib -> foo.sublib, where a sublibrary is defined to be one containing SUBLIBRARY_EXPORTS (vs LIBRARY_EXPORTS).
2010-10-30-16.44.03: For consistency, downcased all .lib filenames: Foo.lib -> foo.lib etc. I had been experimenting with mixed-case library names to make them stand out in a directory listing, but have decided that it is too un-unixy.
2010-10-30-15.58.00: In .lib files, for clarity and conciseness, changed LIBRARY_GROUP_EXPORTS -> SUBLIBRARY_EXPORTS and LIBRARY_GROUP_COMPONENTS -> SUBLIBRARY_COMPONENTS. Also added support for .sublib file extension.
2010-10-30-01.06.53: Renamed */Makefile.lib -> */foo.lib for various values of foo; the unix makefile analogy was counterproductive.
2010-10-29-22.46.16: For conciseness and consistency, renamed foo-lib.lib -> foo.lib for various values of foo.
2010-10-29-13.11.40: Changed from .make6 to .lib filename extensions because the analogy with unix makefiles ultimately does more harm than good: The primary significance of these files to the application programmer is that they define and represent libraries, not that they are re/built using a make-like dependency algorithm.
2010-10-24-18.30.45: For clarity, pervasively renamed make7 -> makelib.
2010-10-24-16.59.23: For clarity, in backend generic packages pervasively renamed asm -> asm_emitter.
2010-10-23-16.38.17: src/app/make7/mythryl-compiler-compiler/: Since .o7 files no longer exist, renamed find-set-of-o7-files-for-executable.pkg -> find-set-of-dotcompiled-files-for-executable.pkg.
2010-10-23-15.51.38: src/app/make7/freezefile/: Since .o7 files no longer exist, renamed iced-o7* -> frozen-compilable*.
2010-10-23-15.44.04: src/app/make7/compilable/: Since .o7 files no longer exist, renamed bare-o7* -> thawed-compilable*.
2010-10-23-14.39.57: Since .o7 files no longer exist, renamed src/app/make7/o7 -> src/app/make7/compilable, src/lib/compiler/execution/o7-file -> src/lib/compiler/execution/dotcompiled-file.
2010-10-22-16.46.15: For clarity, switched from .o7 to .compiled for filenames for compiled files, e.g. foo.pkg.compiled instead of foo.pkg.o7, foo.api.compiled instead of foo.api.o7.
2010-10-22-01.38.38: src/lib/core/: Renamed make-compiler/ -> mythryl-compiler-compiler, MUCH related renaming.
2010-10-20-16.17.23: src/lib/core/internal/: Renamed boot-dictionary.pkg -> src/lib/core/internal/make-compiler-etc.pkg (etc) because it mainly wraps src/app/make7/make-compiler/make-compiler-g.pkg.
2010-10-20-13.52.14: src/lib/core/internal/: Renamed main.pkg -> build-mythryld-heap-image.pkg.
2010-10-20-12.02.57: src/app/make7/semant/: Renamed make7-grammar-actions.pkg -> make6file-grammar-actions.pkg.
2010-10-20-11.51.31: src/app/make7/parse/: Renamed make7.grammar -> make6file.grammar, make7.lex -> make6file.lex, because they in fact describe .make6 files.
2010-10-19-01.47.21: More s/unix/posix/ and s/unix// stuff in the name of clarity, consistency and precision.
2010-10-18-15.38.55: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/: For consistency and clarity, renamed to-unixaddr.c -> to-unix-domain-socket-address.c (etc).
2010-10-18-15.08.14: src/runtime/c-libs/dl/: For clarity and consistency, renamed unix-dynload-lib.c  ->  posix-dynamic-loading-support.c.  Also, deleted dynload-lib.c (redundant unused crud).
2010-10-18-14.55.51: src/runtime/c-libs/: For clarity and consistency, renamed unix-raise-syserr.c -> posix-raise-SYSTEM_ERROR.c.
2010-10-18-14.45.23: src/runtime/machine-dependent/: For clarity and consistency, renamed unix-fault.c  -> posix-arithmetic-trap-handlers.c.
2010-10-18-14.37.00: src/runtime/machine-dependent/: For clarity and consistency, renamed unix-prof.c   -> posix-profiling-support.c.
2010-10-18-14.23.08: For consistency and clarity, renamed src/runtime/config/gen-unix-sigtbl.c -> src/runtime/config/generate-posix-signal-table.c, src/runtime/config/unix-sigtbl.c -> src/runtime/config/posix-signal-table.c.
2010-10-18-14.04.14: For clarity and consistency, renamed src/runtime/machine-dependent/unix-signal.c -> src/runtime/machine-dependent/posix-signal.c.
2010-10-18-13.55.21: For clarity and consistency, renamed src/lib/std/src/posix/unix-signals.pkg -> src/lib/std/src/posix/posix-signals.pkg. (etc)
2010-09-30-12.40.12: Renamed src/runtime/config/unix-signals.c to src/runtime/config/posix-signals.c as part of standardizing on "posix".  Also renamed src/runtime/config/gen-unix-signals.c src/runtime/config/generate-system-signals.h-for-posix-systems.c for clarity and consistency.
2010-10-18-13.21.47: Renamed src/runtime/main/unix-timers.c -> src/runtime/main/posix-timers.c as part of standardizing on 'posix'.
2010-10-18-13.06.15: Moved src/lib/compiler/codegen/ to src/lib/compiler/backend/lower-half/codegen/ where it belongs.
2010-10-18-11.59.10: Renamed all directories named 'unix' to 'posix' because (1) 'posix' is the same length as 'winix' and 'win32', yielding better parallelism and (2) I am standardizing on 'posix' as the name for generic unixy functionality, reserving 'linux' and such for nonportable platform-specific stuff.
2010-10-14-13.05.03: Renamed src/lib/std/src/posix -> src/lib/std/src/posix-1003.1b for clarity and to free up namespace for renaming src/lib/std/src/unix -> src/lib/std/src/posix. Also, added sh/log-change script.
2010-09-30-12.40.12: Globally renamed make7file to make6file, since we currently only have .make6 files.
2010-09-30-10.41.33: src/app/make7/paths/anchor-dictionary.api, from_native() and from_standard(): Renamed spec -> file_path for clarity.
2010-09-29-23.15.11: src/app/make7/depend/: Renamed build-dependency-graph* -> make-dependency-graph*.
2010-09-29-22.15.40: src/app/make7/depend/build-dependency-graph.api: For a narrower, cleaner interface, dropped unneeded API element 'Oh7_View'.
2010-09-29-22.01.29: src/app/make7/depend/build-dependency-graph.api: For a narrower, cleaner interface, dropped unused API elements 'get', 'Looker' and 'process_exports_of_module_dependencies_summary'(?).
2010-09-29-16.04.22: src/app/make7/o7/raw-syntax-to-module-dependencies-summary.pkg: Random cleaning.
2010-09-29-15.26.13: src/app/make7/depend/build-dependency-graph.pkg:  Random cleaning.
2010-09-29-14.38.36: src/app/make7/depend/intra-library-dependency-graph.pkg: For clarity renamed seq/beq/sbeq -> same_bare_o7/same_iced_o7/same_bare_or_iced_o7.
2010-09-29-14.16.24: src/app/make7/depend/intra-library-dependency-graph.pkg: For readability and to reduce clutter, merged in o7-exports.pkg, which contained only a single five-slot datatype definition.
2010-09-29-13.10.53: Renamed five util/ directories (and a miscutil/ for good measure) to stuff/.  Because 'stuff' is a word.  And a syllable shorter.
2010-09-29-12.54.40: src/app/make7/depend/intra-library-dependency-graph.pkg: For readability, changed O7_IS_ICED (tuple) -> O7_IS_ICED {iced_o7,o7_exports,ith}.
2010-09-28-23.44.05: src/app/make7/o7/bare-o7.pkg: Random cleaning and commenting, including moving Bare_O7 api to separate file.
2010-09-28-22.13.45: For clarity and consistency, renamed 'prec-parser' to 'precedence-parser' in various filenames.
2010-09-28-21.45.21: Pervasively renamed 'polylambda' to 'lambdacode' for consistency with the emerging highcode/lowcode/anormcode/fatecode/treecode/... naming pattern.
2010-09-28-20.27.52: Pervasively renamed 'anormal'    to 'anormcode' to fit the emerging highcode/lowcode/fatecode/treecode/... naming convention for intermediate code representations.
2010-09-28-13.31.49: Pervasively renamed 'codetree'   to 'treecode' throughout compiler for improved consistency with emerging highcode/lowcode/... intermediate code name pattern.
2010-09-28-13.31.49: src/app/make7/freezefile/iced-o7.api:  Eliminated now-redudant accessor functions.
2010-09-28-12.02.39: src/app/make7/freezefile/iced-o7.api: Converted Iced_O7 from an opaque type to a simple public record because it is stupid to do implementation hiding when you have no implementation.
2010-09-28-00.31.46: src/app/make7/depend/inter-library-dependency-graph.pkg:  For clarity and consistency, renamed 'library_path' to 'make6_file'.
2010-09-27-23.59.12: src/app/make7/freezefile/iced-o7.pkg: For consistencty and clarity, renamed 'library' -> 'make6_file'.
2010-09-27-23.42.23: src/app/make7/freezefile/iced-o7.pkg: For clarity and consistency renamed runtime_system_pid -> runtime_system_picklehash.  src/app/make7/semant: Renamed sharing.pkg -> sharing-mode.pkg.
2010-09-27-23.03.08: src/app/make7/freezefile/iced-o7.api: For clarity, renamed 'spec' to 'api_or_pkg_file_path'.
2010-09-27-22.35.03: src/app/make7/freezefile/iced-o7.api: For clarity and consistency, renamed 'new' -> 'make_iced_o7'.
2010-09-27-22.24.30: src/app/make7/freezefile/iced-o7.api: For clarity, changed 'offset' to 'byte_offset_in_freezefile'.
2010-09-27-21.03.18: src/app/make7/freezefile/iced-o7.pkg: Iced_O7: Renamed offset -> byte_offset_in_freezefile for clarity.
2010-09-27-13.12.46: src/app/make7/depend/intra-library-dependency-graph.pkg:  Renamed ith_in_freezefile to just ith.
2010-09-27-13.02.14: src/app/make7/depend/intra-library-dependency-graph.pkg:  For readability, changed Far_Iced_O7 from a triple to a record { filter, iced_o7, ith_in_freezefile }.
2010-09-26-20.32.42: src/app/make7/depend/inter-library-dependency-graph.pkg:  For clarity and consistency, changed 'FROZEN Void -> Void' to 'FROZEN   { clear_pickle_cache:  Void -> Void }'.
2010-09-26-14.26.24: src/app/make7/depend/build-dependency-graph.pkg:  Random cleaning.
2010-09-26-13.25.10: src/app/make7/depend/inter-library-dependency-graph.pkg: For readability, changed Oh7_View from a tuple type to { far_o7_thunk, exports_dictionary, visible_symbols } record type.

2010-09-26-10.34.46: src/app/make7/: Random cleaning and commenting.
2010-09-25-23.54.23: src/app/make7/depend/inter-library-dependency-graph.pkg: Renamed type Sublibrarylist -> Libraries since it is in fact a list of Library, not of Sublibrary (which does not as yet exist).
2010-09-25-13.25.55: src/app/make7/main/compile-server.pkg (etc): Renamed (long-obsoleted) build_directory vars/parameters to generated_filename_infix. The old idea was to put separate compiler builds in separate directories; the new idea is to do (e.g.) foo.pkg.o7 vs foo.pkg.ppc-macos.o7 when cross-compiling or such.
2010-09-24-18.23.28: src/app/make7/make-compiler/backend-per-platform.pkg:  Cleaning and commenting.

2010-09-24-14.28.47: src/app/make7/simple-concurrency/unix-compile-client.pkg: For simplicity, eliminated {name,id} Server_Handle type in favor of just returning Compile_Server records to user as an opaque type.
2010-09-23-23.10.47: src/app/make7/simple-concurrency/unix-compile-client.pkg: Collapse 'server_name server' to 'server.name' etc various places, for brevity and clarity.
2010-09-23-20.52.42: src/app/make7/simple-concurrency/unix-compile-client.pkg: Changed Server=SERVER{...} -> Server={...} for simplicity.
2010-09-23-10.54.59: Pervasively adopt 'fatecode' as name for our continuation-passing-style intermediate code format for clarity, parallelism with 'highcode'/'lowcode'/'treecode' intermediate code format names, and because 'cps' and 'fps' are way too obscure while 'continuation_passing_style' and 'fate_passing_style' are way too verbose.
2010-09-19-12.02.25: src/lib/compiler/backend/upper/: For clarity and consistency renamed fps-optimize -> optimize-fatecode
2010-09-19-11.47.49: Test check-in
2010-09-11-11.51.43: For clarity, renamed src/lib/compiler/backend/upper/fps/ -> src/lib/compiler/backend/upper/fatecode/, added a file src/lib/compiler/backend/upper/fatecode/AAA-README.OVERVIEW.
2010-09-11-11.39.10: For clarity, renamed src/lib/compiler/codegen/compile-fps -> src/lib/compiler/codegen/compile-fatecode.
2010-09-11-11.29.22: src/lib/std/src/unix/spawn.api: For brevity renamed spawn::spawn_process -> spawn::process, spawn::spawn_process_in_environment -> spawn::process_in_environment.
2010-09-11-11.08.27: src/lib/std/src/unix/spawn.api: Killed 'spawn' for insufficient value-added -- it was just spawn_process + streams_of.
2010-09-11-10.57.05: src/lib/std/src/unix/spawn.api: For clarity, streams_of now returns { from_stream, to_stream } instead of (from_stream, to_stream).
2010-09-10-15.29.09: src/lib/std/src/unix/spawn.pkg: Light cleaning.
2010-09-10-15.05.34: Random light cleaning.
2010-09-10-13.40.32: src/app/make7/simple-concurrency/unix-compile-client.pkg: For clarity changed Server_Handle from (Int, String) -> { id: Int, name: String }.
2010-09-10-13.26.12: src/app/make7/simple-concurrency/unix-compile-client.pkg: For readability change 'wait_status (server, TRUE)'  ->  'wait_status { server, echo => TRUE }'.
2010-09-09-19.32.19: Random light cleaning and commenting in src/app/make7/simple-concurrency/unix-compile-client.pkg and kith.
2010-09-09-13.02.14: Favoring clarity over brevity, renamed src/lib/compiler/front/ ->  src/lib/compiler/frontend/.  Similarly, created src/lib/compiler/backend/ and moved into it src/lib/compiler/upper/ and src/lib/compiler/lower/.
2010-09-08-23.34.39: src/lib/compiler/lower/tools/parser/: Renamed mdl.lex, mdl.grammar -> machine-description-language.lex, machine-description-language.grammar.
2010-09-08-23.19.40: src/app/make7/paths/anchor-dictionary.pkg: Light cleaning and commenting.
2010-09-08-19.35.14: src/lib/compiler/execution/main/: Renamed importtree.pkg -> import-tree.pkg for clarity and consistency.
2010-09-08-19.23.09: src/lib/compiler/execution/o7-file/oh7-file.pkg: Light cleaning.
2010-09-08-15.00.07: src/app/make7/compile/compile-treewalk-g.pkg: mythryl.lex.pkg was taking -minutes- to compile. Spent a couple of days tracing the CPU consumption to the prettyprint_fps_function() call in src/lib/compiler/upper/main/backend-g.pkg, invoked during verbose compile.log listings.  Must be an O(N**2) algorithm in there or something.  For now, settled for commenting and commenting-out that call.
2010-09-07-16.45.26: src/lib/compiler/upper/main/backend-g.pkg: Simplified compile.log timestamping code via use of cpu_timer::get_added_cpu_time() call.
2010-09-07-16.45.26: src/lib/std/src/cpu-timer.api: Added convenience calls get_added_cpu_time, get_added_usr_and_sys_cpu_time, get_added_gc_and_nongc_usr_and_sys_cpu_times, the first being probably what most people want most of the time.
2010-09-07-16.04.17: src/lib/std/src: Split timer.pkg into cpu-timer.pkg + wallclock-timer.pkg because there is no code in common.  src/lib/std/src/cpu-timer.pkg: Renamed various functions for clarity.
2010-09-07-11.22.00: src/lib/compiler/upper/main/backend-g.pkg: compile.log logic to compute and print elapsed CPU time, adapted from compile-statistics.pkg.
2010-09-05-21.46.34: src/lib/compiler/front/basics/stats/compile-statistics.pkg: Cleaning and commenting; added say_when_nonzero.  src/app/make7/compile/compile-treewalk-g.pkg: Code to set compile_statistics::say_end on a (hardwired) per-file basis.
2010-09-05-16.59.50: src/lib/std/src/timer.api: For clarity and consistency renamed check_real_timer -> get_elapsed_wallclock_time, check_gc_timer -> get_elapsed_garbage_collector_time, check_cpu_timer -> get_elapsed_cpu_time, check_cpu_timers -> get_elapsed_cpu_times.
2010-09-05-16.38.56: src/lib/std/src/timer.api: For clarity and consistency renamed Real_Timer -> Wallclock_Timer, start_cpu_timer -> make_cpu_timer, total_cpu_timer -> get_cpu_timer, start_real_timer -> make_wallclock_timer, total_real_timer -> get_wallclock_timer.
2010-09-05-11.43.28: Phased out last traces of support for .sig, .sml and .grm file extentions (use .api, .pkg and .grammar); yacc, lex and future-lex now produce .api and .pkg files.
2010-09-04-15.56.07: src/app/yacc/src/yacc.pkg, src/app/make7/tools/mlyacc/tool.pkg: Mythryl yacc now generates .api and .pkg files instead of .sig and .sml files (SML/NJ convention).
2010-09-04-13.48.32: src/app/make7/tools/main/private-tools.pkg: Light cleaning.
2010-09-04-13.17.19: src/app/make7/simple-concurrency/unix-compile-client.pkg, src/app/make7/main/compile-server.pkg: Light cleaning.
2010-09-04-12.56.19: src/app/make7/paths/anchor-dictionary.pkg: Move package synonymous outside package per current convention.
2010-09-03-14.06.35: src/app/make7/util/: Rename symbolset.pkg -> symbol-set.pkg, symbolmap.pkg -> symbol-map.pkg, symbolordkey.pkg symbol-ord-key.pkg
2010-09-01-14.40.50: src/app/make7/compile/compile-treewalk-g.pkg: Light cleaning.  src/app/make7/paths/: Rename srcpathmap.pkg -> source-path-map.pkg, srcpathset.pkg -> source-path-set.pkg
2010-09-01-13.41.58: src/app/make7/make-compiler/make-compiler-g.pkg: Rename 'os' parameter to 'os_kind' for clarity and consistency.
2010-08-31-16.53.02: x-kit/tut/triangle/triangle-app.pkg: check_drawing_window_triangle_draw(): Final assert was failing -- probably a race condition (worked on maw over net) -- commented it out rather than track it down right now.   src/app/make7/main/compile-server.pkg: fun enter_server_loop: Renamed 'load' parameter to 'make'' for consistency.
2010-08-31-15.56.04: src/app/make7/main/make7-g.pkg: Move package abbreviations above generic package per current convention.
2010-08-31-15.09.56: src/lib/std/src/unix/threadkit-winix-process.pkg: Move package abbreviations above main package, per usual convention.
2010-08-10-10.12.14: src/runtime/o/mythryl.c: Back out change wrapping script in { ... }.  src/lib/compiler/front/typechecker/basics/typechecking-control.pkg:  Due to previous, make value_restriction_top_warn once again default to FALSE.
2010-08-04-23.32.31: src/lib/src/gtk-glue.config: Commenting.
2010-08-04-17.12.12: src/runtime/o/mythryl.c: Wrap script in { } to reduce value-restriction issues.  src/lib/compiler/front/typechecker/basics/typechecking-control.pkg: Default value_restriction_top_warn to TRUE.
2010-08-03-14.32.25: src/lib/x-kit/: Added CYNBE-CONCLUSIONS.OVERVIEW.
2010-08-02-18.45.03: x-kit: Renamed realize parameters from { kidplug, window, size } -> { kidplug, window, window_size }.
2010-08-02-10.26.57: src/lib/x-kit/widget/fancy/graphviz/graphviz-widget.pkg: Random cleaning and commenting.
2010-07-31-15.45.33: Moved src/lib/x-kit/tut/show-graph/graph-view/* to src/lib/x-kit/widget/fancy/graphviz/ and src/lib/x-kit/tut/show-graph/text-view/* to src/lib/x-kit/widget/fancy/graphviz/text because these are generally useful re-usable widgets.
2010-07-31-11.13.01: src/lib/x-kit/tut/show-graph/graph-view/: Renamed graph-view* -> scrollable-graphviz-widget*.
2010-07-30-14.43.02: src/lib/x-kit/tut/show-graph/README: Updated.
2010-07-29-22.16.36: Still fiddling with the badbricks-game-app-export.pkg issue.
2010-07-28-18.37.26: Ditto
2010-07-28-17.44.19: Ditto.
2010-07-28-16.44.39: More of same.
2010-07-28-11.36.25: Exploring why mythryl7.110.58/src/lib/x-kit/tut/badbricks-game/badbricks-game-app-export.pkg appears missing on github: Added an -export2.pkg copy of it.
2010-07-21-09.47.14: src/lib/x-kit/tut/badbricks-game/badbricks-game-app-export.pkg: Did a nop-edit to see if that will humor git -- github apparently lacks this file.
2010-07-19-00.06.39: src/lib/x-kit/tut/show-graph/graph-view/: Renamed graph-viewer.pkg -> graphviz-widget.pkg (etc) for clarity.
2010-07-18-22.16.44: src/lib/x-kit/tut/show-graph/graph-view/: Renamed view-font.pkg -> font-family-cache.pkg because that is what it is.
2010-07-18-15.38.10: src/lib/x-kit/tut/show-graph/: Show-graph window opening at 1600 rather than 3800 pixels wide under Xinerama seems to be window manager issue, not x-kit issue.
2010-07-13-19.44.25: src/lib/x-kit/tut/show-graph/graph-view/: Moved planar-graph stuff to src/lib/std/dot/ to make it more generally accessible.
2010-07-13-19.12.53: Moved xgeometry-float.pkg from src/lib/x-kit/tut/show-graph/graph-view/ to src/lib/std/2d/, for consistency with xgeometry.pkg
2010-07-13-11.55.06: src/lib/std/dot/: Established this directory to hold support for Graphviz .dot file format, moved relevant files here from src/lib/x-kit/tut/show-graph/graph/ to make them generally available. (Moved the yacc libraries to stdlib also, since they are needed by the .dot file reader, and should really be considered standard functionality.)
2010-07-13-10.42.32: src/lib/x-kit/tut/show-graph/graph/: Dropped some disused files, apparently just ancient crud.
2010-07-13-10.07.34: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xclient.pkg: Tidying.
2010-07-13-09.36.12: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xclient.api: Moved atom_* into new subpackage atom and dropped the atom_prefixes.
2010-07-13-09.15.15: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xclient.api: Merged xclient::selection      subpackage into main xclient package to produce a flatter, more conventional and convenient api.
2010-07-13-08.38.58: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xclient.api: Merged xclient::window         subpackage into main xclient package to produce a flatter, more conventional and convenient api.
2010-07-13-06.53.00: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xclient.api: Merged xclient::draw           subpackage into main xclient package to produce a flatter, more conventional and convenient api.

2010-07-12-16.07.13: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xclient.api: Moved Pen_Trait into its own package p.
2010-07-12-15.02.30: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xclient.api: Eliminated xclient::font package, merging its remaining contents (one exception) into main xclient package.
2010-07-12-14.00.48: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/: Eliminated xclient_sharing: The xclient interface now consists simply of xclient.api + xclient.pkg. (Yay!)
2010-07-11-22.09.11: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/: Moved xgeometry.api, xgeometry.pkg and range-check.pkg to src/lib/std/2d/ (i.e., stdlib).

2010-07-09-21.18.26: src/lib/x-kit/tut/show-graph/graph/traitful-graphtree-g.pkg: Dropped the kind graph field, which was unused and of unclear utility; apparently an idea that died a-borning. (Might have distinguished the four non/strict di/graph cases.)

2010-05-15-02.17.21: src/lib/x-kit/tut/bitmap-editor/: Cleaning and commenting. Some files were bitrotted because not compiled because although listed in the .make6 file they were not exported from it. Oops. Fixed.

2010-05-13-18.32.57: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/sendevent-to-wire.pkg: encode_send_buttonrelease_xevent: Fixed: Was using event::button_press_xevent where event::button_release_xevent was needed (sloppy cut-and-paste programming *blush*).
2010-05-12-16.55.17: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xcore.api (etc): Added send_''mouse_enter''_xevent, send_''mouse_leave''_xevent complements to send_mousebutton_press_xevent, send_mousebutton_release_xevent.

2010-05-06-05.00.31: src/lib/x-kit/tut/calc/: Light cleaning.
2010-05-06-04.44.36: src/lib/x-kit/tut/nbody/: Selfcheck now actually checks something. :-)
2010-05-06-01.53.12: src/lib/std/src/time.api: Killed now() as redundant -- we are going to have a lot of different times in the end.  Renamed get() -> get_current_time_utc() for clarity.
2010-05-05-13.47.37: src/lib/x-kit/tut/nbody/:  Hooked up to unit-test logic in src/lib/x-kit/tut/xkit-tut-unit-test.pkg.
2010-05-04-04.40.36: src/lib/x-kit/tut/nbody/: Random cleaning and commenting.
2010-05-03-03.11.42: src/lib/x-kit/tut/plaid/plaid-app.pkg: selfcheck() now actually checks something. :-)
2010-05-02-03.32.41: src/lib/x-kit/tut/xkit-tut-unit-test.pkg:  Now exercises plaid-app as well as triangle-app.
2010-05-01-01.15.32: src/lib/x-kit/tut/plaid/plaid-app.pkg: Now exits when user clicks on windowframe close button.
2010-05-01-00.46.16: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/:  Killed off window-io.pkg:  It was just clutter, containing only three small functions used only in src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/window.pkg.
2010-04-30-21.42.24: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/topwindow.api: Concluded that the mysterious Dusty Deboer 'delete' slot is intended to signal WM_DELETE_WINDOW X events to applications. Much commenting and renaming to clarify this to library users and code maintainers.
2010-04-29-23.53.50: src/lib/x-kit/tut/triangle/triangle-app.pkg:  Stripped out much debug crud.
2010-04-29-23.26.53: src/lib/x-kit/tut/triangle/triangle-app.pkg:  Added unit test to exercise mouse pointer get/set.

2010-04-26-03.34.40: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/cs-pixmap.pkg: Hacked make_clientside_pixmap_from_window to flush to_topwindow_drawimp but make_clientside_pixmap_from_readwrite_pixmap to flush to_screen_drawimp. This matches the xkit drawing convention; consequently triangle-app now self-checks correctly.
2010-04-26-03.17.26: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/xsession.api et al: Much renaming of fields etc for clarity, in particular to draw a bright line between draw-imps global to a screen and those local to a particular application top-level window and its subwindows.
2010-04-26-00.10.24: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/xsession.api: Renamed SCREEN.screen -> SCREEN.screen_info (it is of type Screen_Info).
2010-04-25-05.07.58: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xdraw.api: Add drawimp_thread_id_of call.  src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xcore.api: Added id_of_window, id_of_rw_pixmap, id_of_ro_pixmap calls.  The problem was that windows etc had no visible identity at the application programmer level, nor was there any easy way to distinguish which ones used which draw imps.  This make useful tracelog debugging of them virtually impossible.
2010-04-24-23.21.05: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/thread.api: Rename get_thread -> get_current_thread; have it throw THREAD_SCHEDULER_NOT_RUNNING rather than return a garbage pointer;  rename get_thread_name -> get_current_thread's_name;  add get_current_thread's_id.  src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg: Include thread_id in tracelog line prologues;  src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/print-if.c: Match columns to revised trace.pkg output format.
2010-04-24-22.45.01: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/internal-threadkit-types.pkg: For clarity and consistency renamed THREAD.id -> THREAD.thread_id.
2010-04-24-22.28.30: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/thread.pkg (etc): Renamed Thread_Id -> Thread everywhere in support of the emerging convention that Foo is a record and Foo_Id is a number.
2010-04-24-20.00.32: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xsocket.pkg: Random internal cleaning and commenting.
2010-04-24-19.19.34: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/: Renamed graphics-context-cache.pkg -> pen-to-gcontext-imp.pkg for clarity.  src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/xsession.pkg: Added draw-imp and pen-to-gcontext-imp to master diagram.

2010-04-24-01.47.28: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-time/timeofday.c: Add comments pointing to TSR, HPET and clock_gettime().
2010-04-24-00.26.34: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/: Ripped out ximage.api, ximage.pkg: Too big a can of worms to open right now.
2010-04-22-00.13.16: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/: Renamed rgb-image.api, rgb-image.pkg -> ximage.api, ximage.pkg because they are X-specific and we will probably eventually want a generic rgb_image package.
2010-04-21-23.57.41: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/: Establish rgb-image.api, rgb-image.pkg.
2010-04-21-23.00.46: src/lib/x-kit/: Globally renamed Drawable_Window, DRAWABLE_WINDOW -> Drawable, DRAWABLE.
2010-04-21-13.55.12: src/lib/x-kit/tut/triangle/triangle-app.pkg: Fixed race condition: I was generating simulated mouseclick before setting up the trap to detect its result -- and got bitten despite network roundtrip delay(?!?)
2010-04-20-00.21.34: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/wire-to-value.api: decode_xevent: Document formerly mysterious Bool return value: Tells whether event was synthesized via SendEvent.
2010-04-19-21.28.05: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/cs-pixmap.api: Added same_cs_pixmap call.
2010-04-19-21.08.12: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xgeometry.api: package size: Added eq: (Size, Size) -> Bool.
2010-04-19-20.03.12: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/cs-pixmap.api: Added make_clientside_pixmap_from_window().
2010-04-19-14.30.49: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xsocket.api: Renaming for clarity: request_reply -> send_xrequest_and_read_reply, etc.
2010-04-19-02.01.12: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xsocket.pkg: Tweaked inbuf_imp to do nonblocking reads from X server socket. Now background tasks continue to run properly while x-kit is waiting for user X-event input -- much better!
2010-04-19-00.31.19: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xsocket.pkg: inbuf_imp: Add receive_vector_nonblocking fn as alternative to existing blocking-read X input call.
2010-04-18-23.31.03: src/lib/std/src/socket/socket-guts.pkg: More cleaning and commenting.
2010-04-18-23.19.20: src/lib/std/src/socket/socket-guts.pkg: Cleaning and commenting.
2010-04-18-22.54.31: src/lib/std/src/socket/socket-guts.pkg, src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/setNBIO.c: Cleaning and commenting.

2010-04-18-21.06.51: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/thread.pkg: Changed get_thread_name to not call get_thread_id (and thus not SEGV) when thread scheduler is not running. This is a workaround not a fix, but much better than nothing.
2010-04-18-20.34.23: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/thread-scheduler.pkg: Discovered the hard way that calling  get_current_thread = unsafe::get_current_thread_register when thread_scheduler is not running can SEGV you.  E.g., calling thread::get_thread_name will do this. Documented with a comment.
2010-04-18-17.18.51: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg: Eliminated much needless use of thread/mailslot functionality in order to make print_if tracelogging usable in a wider range of environments.
2010-04-17-23.44.49: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/thread-scheduler.pkg: Added tracelog support and instrumentation. (thread-scheduler is an awkward special case because the regular thread/mailslot based mechanism does not work inside thread-scheduler itself, and also due to a package-cycle problem.)
2010-04-17-18.03.18: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-runtime/cfun-list.h: Change setIntTimer -> setIntervalTimer for clarity.
2010-04-17-14.54.02: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/xsession.api: Added some TO-DO rumination on suporting David Patternson's warthog/trampoline capability/interface model in the evolving Mythryl concurrency/OOP paradigm.
2010-04-16-23.55.16: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-runtime/setitimer.c, src/runtime/machine-dependent/unix-signal.c: Additional instrumentation via print_if.
2010-04-16-13.30.00: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/geometry.pkg: Import src/lib/x-kit/tut/plaid/plaid-app.pkg: symmetric_difference(box,box) as box::xor, since it is of general utility.
2010-04-15-23.25.16: src/lib/x-kit/tut/plaid/plaid-app.pkg: Random cleaning and commenting.
2010-04-15-22.25.10: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/draw-types.api etc: Renamed screen_depth -> screen_depth_imps because the former sounds like an integer; renamed id -> pixmap_id various places for clarity.
2010-04-14-13.33.59: src/lib/x-kit/tut/triangle/: Deleted tri.out, tri.out1. These were apparently years-old object code files or some such. Junk.
2010-04-13-20.06.16: src/lib/x-kit/tut/xkit-tut-unit-test.pkg: triangle_app::selfcheck () now runs sucessfully.
2010-04-13-19.49.37: src/lib/x-kit/tut/xkit-tut-unit-test.pkg:  Establish this new unit test file, integrate into make check framework.

2010-04-13-17.07.53: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xgeometry.api: Similarly established (sub) package box.
2010-04-13-16.26.26: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xgeometry.api: Established (sub) package size, moved into it add_size, sub_size, scale_size as add, subtract, scale.
2010-04-13-16.09.01: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xgeometry.api: Moved limit_pt into package point as clip; Moved add_size_to_pt into package point as add_size. Re-ordered arguments to point::scale to put point first.
2010-04-13-15.50.50: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xgeometry.api: Established (sub) package point; moved into it point_00, row_coord_of_pt, col_coord_of_pt, scale_point, add_points, subtract_points, point_ne, point_eq, point_gt, point_lt, point_ge, point_le as zero, row_coord_of, col_coord_of, scale, add, subtract, ne, eq, gt, lt, ge, le.
2010-04-13-15.34.20: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xgeometry.api: Added point_ne, point_ge, point_gt to complete the traditional (hence expected) set.
2010-04-13-15.09.29: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xgeometry.api: Renamed less_than_pt, less_eq_point -> point_lt, point_le; added point_eq.
2010-04-13-15.09.29: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xgeometry.api: Renamed add_pt, sub_pt -> add_points, subtract_points.
2010-04-13-03.11.59: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/xsession.pkg: send_mousebutton_press_xevent, send_mousebutton_release_xevent: I had x=row, y=col, oops. Fixed by reversing them.
2010-04-13-02.06.49: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/value-to-wire.api: For clarity renamed pt -> point, str -> string various places.
2010-04-13-01.50.00: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/xsocket-to-topwindow-router.api: Renamed note_window's_seen_first_expose_oneshot -> note_window's_''seen_first_expose''_oneshot for clarity -- and because I can. :-)
2010-04-12-23.11.53: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/xsession.api: Renamed drawop_sink -> to_drawimp, which is both shorter and clearer.
2010-04-12-22.48.29: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/xsession.api: Rename draw_command_sink -> drawop_sink for brevity.
2010-04-12-14.59.02: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/value-to-wire.api: More work establishing a clear distinction between gc records and 29-bit gc IDs.
2010-04-12-01.23.34: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/graphics-context-cache.pkg: Work at maintaining clearer distinction between gc records and 29-bit integer gc ID values.
2010-04-12-01.23.34: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/draw.pkg: Moved Text+Text_Item into their own package t, dropped the TEXT_ prefixes.
2010-04-12-01.08.09: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/draw-types.api: For clarity and namespace sanity, moved Draw_Root into its own package r, renamed DWIN -> WINDOW, DPM -> PIXMAP.
2010-04-12-00.54.56: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/draw.pkg: Nuke another bloody include.
2010-04-11-20.15.01: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/draw-types.api: Renamed draw_fn -> draw_command_sink for clarity.
2010-04-11-19.20.27: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/draw-imp.pkg: More random tidying.
2010-04-11-18.55.57: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/draw-imp.api: For clarity renamed package c -> s, within it Config -> Mapped_State, MAP -> TOPWINDOW_IS_NOW_MAPPED, UNMAP -> TOPWINDOW_IS_NOW_UNMAPPED.
2010-04-11-17.37.23: src/lib/compiler/front/parse/lex/mythryl-token-table-g.pkg: Killed the "&&" and "||" reserved words. These were synonyms of "and" and "or" intended to comfort C programmers, but they do not get used enough to justify keeping them around.
2010-04-11-16.46.00: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/draw-imp.api: Moved Destroy_Item into its own package d to get rid of distracting DESTROY_ prefix.

2010-04-11-14.24.02: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/draw-imp.api: Moved Draw_Op into its own package o to eliminate the bloody DOP_ prefixes.
2010-04-11-14.10.15: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/draw-imp.pkg: Squished another bloody-bedamned include statement.
2010-04-11-13.58.31: Random cleaning and commenting in src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/draw-imp.pkg, src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/value-to-wire-core.pkg.

2010-04-07-01.40.36: triangle-app.pkg had stopped working; traced to not including new NOTE_EXPOSE_AND_SEND_TO_WINDOW case in xevent_action_to_string() in src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/xsocket-to-topwindow-router.pkg. Lesson: Do not ignore compiler not exhaustive warnings. :-)
2010-04-06-12.59.53: Added logic to signal when a widget is up and running, interpreted as meaning when its first EXPOSE event arrives from the X server. This comprises seen_first_redraw_oneshot_of() in src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/widget.api plus as supporting infrastructure note_seen_first_expose_oneshot in src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/window.api and note_window's_seen_first_expose_oneshot in src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/xsocket-to-topwindow-router.api.
2010-04-05-16.24.44: Changed tacks: Widgets do not know their sizes, instead they know their window and their window knows its size (and position). Consequently: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/widget.api: Dropped note_new_size(). src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/widget.pkg: Dropped WIDGET.size field.

2010-04-02-18.00.54: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/xsocket-to-topwindow-router.pkg: More general cleaning.
2010-04-02-17.40.48: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/xsocket-to-topwindow-router.pkg: General cleaning, more work establishing a clear distinction between window and window_id values.
2010-04-02-03.02.51: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/window.pkg: Move window_point_to_screen_point def to src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/xsession.pkg to break a package cycle.
2010-04-02-02.23.54: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/window.api: Renamed window_pt_to_screen_pt -> window_point_to_screen_point. What is it about programming and dyslexia? :-)
2010-04-02-02.10.27: Globally renamed translate_coords -> translate_coordinates. Remember, every time you mangle a word, God kills a kitten. Think of the kittens.
2010-04-02-01.50.42: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xtypes.pkg: Renamed subpackage wa -> a per new package naming convention.

2010-03-28-15.33.11: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xsocket.pkg: Added query_colors().
2010-03-28-15.19.40: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xsocket.pkg: Added query_best_size().

2010-03-25-00.36.49: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/internal-threadkit-types.pkg et al:  Renamed MAILOP_ENABLED, MAILOP_BLOCKED ->  MAILOP_READY, MAILOP_UNREADY for clarity and symmetry, and because blocking is for threads, not mailops.
2010-03-25-00.17.05: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/mailop.pkg et al: Renamed poll_fn, block_fn, do_fn -> is_ready, wait_for, do_it for clarity and because _fn suffixes on function names are just clutter.
2010-03-24-23.40.43: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/core-thread-kit/mailop.pkg: Pervasively change grp,GRP -> group,GROUP for clarity.

2010-03-21-21.15.40: src/lib/x-kit/tut/triangle/triangle-app.pkg: make_draw_threads:  Changed to draw triangles in green -- apparently at some point I accidentally changed it to draw black triangles on a black background, which looks unimpressive to say the least. :-) triangle-app now appears to be basically functional! :-) :-) :-)
2010-03-20-14.38.44: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xsocket.pkg: sequencer_imp_main_loop: FIXED: I had incorrectly transformed   fun loop x = loop( select ... ); -> fun loop x = for (;;) { select ... ; }; in a case where the  select  returned a non-Void value.
2010-03-19-18.02.56: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/wire-to-value.pkg: Additional tracelogging.

2010-03-12-21.15.33: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/: Rename color-imp.api, color-imp.pkg ->  color-spec.api, color-spec.pkg: Colortable stuff is now Officially Dead! :-) :-) :-)
2010-03-12-12.42.06: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/color-imp.api: Eliminate Rgb type definition (just a re-export of rgb::Rgb).
2010-03-12-12.21.38: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/color-imp.api: Ripped out make_color_imp(), and with it nearly all remaining code in color-imp.pkg.
2010-03-11-21.52.13: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/color-imp.api: Eliminate color_imp argument from get_color().

2010-03-10-13.22.20: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/color/: Rename rgb24.pkg -> rgb8.pkg because bits-per-color-component is a more practical general naming scheme.
2010-03-10-03.05.01: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/color/: Split x11-color-name.pkg off from rgb24.pkg, partly to avoid cyclicity problems, partly because it is better in a separate package anyhow.
2010-03-10-03.05.01: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/color/yiq.pkg: Total rewrite. :-)
2010-03-10-01.59.35: Globally renamed xrgb -> rgb24, taking 24-bitness as primary and X protocol applications as secondary.

2010-03-09-23.47.06: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/color/xrgb.api: Add from_floats(), to_floats(): I want to make floating point triples the standard color notation.
2010-03-09-21.47.49: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/color/rgb.pkg: Change  Rgb = RGB { red: Unt, green: Unt, blue: Unt }   ->  Rgb = rw_float_vector::Rw_Vector
2010-03-09-20.17.09: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/stuff/xclient-unit-test.pkg: Force hue-saturation-value.pkg to compile.  src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/color/hue-saturation-value.pkg: Change  Hsv = HSV { hue: float, saturation: Float, value: Float }   ->  Hsv = fv::Rw_Vector  for efficiency.   src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/color/rgb.api:  Add from_floats(), to_floats().

2010-03-08-21.01.40: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/color/rgb.api: Make exported Rgb type opaque; add from_unts(), to_unts() and same().
2010-03-08-19.20.26: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/color/: Establish rgb.api, rgb.pkg;  move Rgb definition over from src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xtypes.pkg.
2010-03-08-19.01.22: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xtypes.pkg: Drop Xrgb type altogether, redirecting all references to xrgb.pkg.
2010-03-08-14.06.03: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xtypes.pkg: Replace   Xrgb = XRGB Int   with   Xrgb = xrgb::Xrgb

2010-03-08-13.08.09: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/: mkdir color/, cp stuff/color* color, split color.api -> hue-saturation-value.api + yiq.api.
2010-03-08-12.18.57: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/: Create to-string/, mv stuff/*to-string* into it.
2010-03-07-22.18.16: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/stuff/xclient-unit-test.pkg: exercise_window_stuff: Check assumption that root visual is depth=24 red/green/blue masks FF0000/00FF00/0000FF, and bypass unit tests if not.
2010-03-07-21.51.27: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/stuff/xserver-info-to-string.pkg:  Improve formatting. (Considerably!)  src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/value-to-wire.api: encode_create_window: Rename io -> io_class for clarity.  src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/window-io.api: create_window: Rename io -> io_class for clarity and consistency.  src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xtypes.pkg: Rename Input_Output -> Io_Class for clarity and consistency.
2010-03-07-11.41.03: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xsocket.pkg:  Top-of-file motivational comments.
2010-03-06-20.17.09: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/stuff/xclient-unit-test.pkg: Now actually creates a visible window! :-) :-) :-)
2010-03-05-21.40.52: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/draw-types.api: WINDOW: Renamed id -> window_id for clarity and consistency.
2010-03-05-21.17.30: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/value-to-wire.api: Rename window -> window_id various places for clarity and consistency.
2010-03-05-20.03.19: For clarity and consistency, in src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/window-io.api: create_window: Renamed id, parent -> window_id, parent_id.  In src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/value-to-wire.api: encode_create_window: Renamed window, parent -> window_id, parent_id.
2010-03-05-19.16.13: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/: For clarity and consistency rename xevent-to-topwindow-router.pkg ->  xsocket-to-topwindow-router.pkg, widgettree-root-xevent-router.pkg -> topwindow-to-widget-router.pkg. Break out xsocket-to-topwindow-router.api as a separate file.
2010-03-05-18.40.04: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/: Renamed xbuf-to-widgettree-xevent-router.pkg -> xevent-to-topwindow-router.pkg for conciseness, perhaps slightly improved clarity.
2010-03-05-03.51.27: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xsocket.pkg: Cleaning and commenting.
2010-03-05-01.44.23: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xsocket.pkg: outbuf_imp: loop() was ignoring max_bytes_per_socket_write, clearly a bug: Fixed.  Much commenting.
2010-03-04-18.41.30: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xsocket.api: Renamed   exception LOST_REPLAY  ->   exception LOST_REPLY.  (I think the former was my typo in the heat of battle... *blush*)
2010-03-04-00.43.08: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/display.api: XSCREEN: Renamed black,white -> black_pixel,white_pixel for clarity and consistency.
2010-03-04-00.27.45: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/stuff/xclient-unit-test.pkg: Successful (and plausible) call to v2w::encode_create_window.
2010-03-03-23.28.23: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/value-to-wire.api: encode_create_window, encode_change_window_attributes: Change attributes arg from xt::Value_List -> List( xt::wa::Window_Attribute );  Make make_window_attribute_list private to value-to-wire.pkg.
2010-03-03-22.56.00: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/window-io.api: Move Window_Attribute to src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xtypes.pkg, move make_window_attribute_list -> src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/value-to-wire.api.
2010-03-03-22.17.10: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/window.pkg: Rename std_xevent_mask -> standard_xevent_mask.
2010-03-03-21.51.16: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/value-to-wire.api:  encode_create_window, encode_change_window_attributes: Rename vals -> attributes for clarity.
2010-03-03-20.27.16: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xtypes.pkg: Renamed VALMASK,VALS -> VALUE_MASK, VALUE_LIST for clarity and consistency with X protocol docs.
2010-03-03-20.27.16: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/window-io.api: Renamed Xwin_Val -> Window_Attribute because the latter is not gibberish.
2010-03-03-20.27.16: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/window.api: make_simple_top_window, make_simple_subwindow, make_transient_window, make_simple_popup_window: Renamed parameters geometry,border,background -> site,border_color,background_color for clarity.
2010-03-03-19.48.31: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xtypes.pkg: Add Visual_Id_Choice = SAME_VISUAL_AS_PARENT | OVERRIDE_PARENT_VISUAL Visual_Id.  src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/window-io.api: create_window: Change visual_id from Null_Or(Visual_ID) -> Visual_Id_Choice, thus changing typical argument from NULL to the more readable SAME_VISUAL_AS_PARENT.
2010-03-03-16.49.17: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/window-io.ap: create_window: Renamed input_only -> io; replaced gibberish values NULL/THE TRUE/THE FALSE by INPUT_ONLY/INPUT_OUTPUT/SAME_IO_AS_PARENT.
2010-03-03-16.27.08: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/geometry.pkg: For concision renamed Window_Footprint, WINDOW_FOOTPRINT -> Window_Site, WINDOW_SITE.
2010-03-03-12.30.50: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/value-to-wire.api: encode_create_window: Rename id -> visual_id for clarity.
2010-03-03-12.04.00: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/xtypes.pkg: For clarity, change VISUAL.id -> VISUAL.visual_id.
2010-03-03-01.29.58: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/display.pkg: Dusty Deboer had ad-hoc retry logic hammered in on X-server connect and read-reply. Removed the former; naive retry will not work for connect() anyhow.  Replaced the latter (which is in fact needed due to 50Hz SIGALRM generating EINTRs in recv.c) with better-written pre-existing retry_syscall_on_eintr code.
2010-03-02-03.14.36: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-c.h: Tweaked RAISE_SYSERR and RAISE_ERROR to correctly report both file and line number (e.g., foo.c:13 instead of just foo.c) for C-originated Mythryl exceptions.
2010-03-02-02.30.30: src/lib/std/src/threadkit/unix/: Renamed syscall.pkg -> retry-syscall-on-eintr.pkg -- because that is what it does. :-) 
2010-03-01-18.23.35: src/lib/std/src/threadkit/unix/: Renamed syscall.pkg -> retry-syscall-on-eintr.pkg -- because that is what it does. :-) 
2010-03-01-18.23.35: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/display.api: For clarity, renamed XSCREEN.root -> XSCREEN.root_window_id.
2010-03-01-17.37.55: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/root-window.pkg: For clarity rename ROOT_WINDOW.next_id -> ROOT_WINDOW.next_widget_id.
2010-03-01-17.26.51: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/root-window.pkg: For clarity and consistency rename ROOT_WINDOW.make_id -> ROOT_WINDOW.next_id :-)
2010-03-01-17.13.47: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/root-window.pkg: For clarity rename ROOT_WINDOW.id_fn -> ROOT_WINDOW.make_id, since that is what it does.
2010-03-01-16.14.36: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/window/: Created xsession.api -- kinda crazy for a module as big as xsession.pkg to have no explicit API definition.
2010-03-01-14.52.35: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/stuff/xclient-unit-test.pkg: Cleanly close tracelog at end, using new tracing::currently_tracing_to() fn.
2010-03-01-12.54.56: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.api: Added currently_tracing_to () fn.
2010-02-28-23.38.55: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/display.pkg: Consistently report X server connection failures via XSERVER_CONNECT_ERROR exception, and attempt to be more clear about the problem.  src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/stuff/xclient-unit-test.pkg: Trap XSERVER_CONNECT_ERROR cleanly, report it, and abort all remaining xclient unit tests.
2010-02-28-22.36.46: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xcore.api and elsewhere: Renamed BAD_ADDRESS -> XSERVER_CONNECT_ERROR for clarity.
2010-02-28-20.58.03: Changed *.LOAD_LOG -> *.load.log to further reduce the shouting.
2010-02-28-20.34.43: Generate foo.make6.index files instead of foo.make6.INDEX files, to reduce the shouting.
2010-02-28-16.34.25: For improved clarity, globally changed foo.make6.a7 freezefile names to foo.make6.frozen.
2010-02-28-15.30.34: Generate .compile.log files instead of .COMPILE_LOG files -- got tired of the shouting.
2010-02-28-14.42.34: Makefile: Added rest-a7-clean target to remove the freezefiles (.a7 files) created by doing make rest.
2010-02-26-22.31.12: Backed out all those proactive EINTR retries pending better understanding -- see discussion at bottom of src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/connect.c
2010-02-26-21.30.16: Quite a bit of fiddling. In particular: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/hexdump-if.c: Wrote this to provide classic hex+ascii tracelogging of socket traffic.  src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/stuff/xclient-unit-test.pkg: Changed this to pass authentication info to open_xdisplay; now succeeds in contacting X server and decoding connect request reply. Also did some fiddling to make authentication.pkg visible and usable both inside and outside xclient library, and to get type sharing right.
2010-02-24-03.11.51: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xauthentication.(api,pkg): Commenting.
2010-02-23-23.44.26: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xauthentication.(api,pkg): Commenting.
2010-02-23-22.26.32: src/runtime/c-libs/: More proactive EINTR retries. NB: JHReppy emailed that not retrying on EINTR at the C level was a deliberate SML/NJ design decision. Fair enough, although it makes my hair stand on end.
2010-02-23-12.33.18: src/runtime/c-libs/posix-os/poll.c: Proactively handle EINTR. Change wahtever -> whatever in previous fixes, also status == -1 to status < 0, which seems traditional for some reason.
2010-02-23-04.18.29: src/runtime/c-libs/posix-io/: Proactively handle EINTR in close.c, dup2.c, dup.c, fcntl_d.c, fcntl_gfd.c, fcntl_gfl.c, fcntl_l_64.c, fcntl_l.c, fcntl_sfd.c, fcntl_sfl.c, readbuf.c, read.c, writebuf.c, write.c.
2010-02-23-03.51.55: src/runtime/c-libs/posix-filesys/: Proactively handle EINTR errors in openf.c, ftruncate.c, ftruncate_64.c.
2010-02-23-03.21.54: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/connect.c: Added a select() loop to handle EINTR during connect(), per Unix Network Programming p452.
2010-02-23-02.10.44: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/: Proactively add retries on EINTR to various calls because with a 50HZ SIGALRM running to support concurrency, interrupted calls are a significant potential problem.
2010-02-23-00.23.14: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xcore.api: For clarity, renamed Authentication,AUTHENTICATION -> Xauthentication,XAUTHENTICATION, similar renamings elsewhere.
2010-02-22-23.36.17: src/lib/x-kit/: draw/get-display(api,pkg) had nothing to do with drawing and no real distinction from xclient/xauthentication(api,pkg) functionality, so merged former into latter to reduce clutter and rationalize. For clarity, renamed fn parse_display -> parse_xdisplay_string, fn get_display -> get_xdisplay_string_and_xauthentication.
2010-02-22-23.02.55: src/lib/x-kit/: X authentication has nothing to do with X drawing, so moved x11-authentication.(api,pkg) from draw/ -> xclient/, renaming to xauthentication.(api,pkg) for stylistic consistency with the other files there.
2010-02-22-22.44.25: src/lib/x-kit/draw/x11-authentication.api: For clarity, renamed auth_file_name -> get_xauthority_filename, get_auth_by_addr -> get_xauthority_file_entry_by_address, get_best_auth_by_addr -> get_best_xauthority_file_entry_by_address, read_authentication_file -> get_selected_xauthority_file_entries, auth_names -> acceptable_authentication_methods.
2010-02-22-22.03.28: src/lib/x-kit/draw/: For clarity renamed xauth.api,xauth.pkg -> x11-authentication.api,x11-authentication.pkg.
2010-02-22-02.39.44: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/: sendbuf.c, recv.c: More tracelog print_if stuff.
2010-02-22-00.20.26: src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/socket.c: Added much tracelog support. src/lib/std/src/socket/socket-guts.pkg: ctl_rcvbuf was bound to ctlSNDBUF instead of ctlRCVBUF. (Should maybe fix this in SML/NJ.) src/runtime/c-libs/lib7-socket/*.c: Commenting.

2010-02-19-13.54.29: src/lib/std/src/: Renamed string-conversion.api,string-conversion.pkg -> number-string.api,number-string.pkg for brevity and clarity -- they are more about numbers than strings.
2010-02-19-13.08.32: src/lib/std/src/socket/: Renamed unix-generic-socket.pkg -> generic-socket.pkg for clarity and as part of concentrating on being posix-centric rather than cross-platform-centric.

2010-02-17-14.31.33: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/stuff/xclient-unit-test.pkg: (Re-)Established this unit test: Now is is run by src/lib/test/all-unit-tests.pkg (like all unit tests) but compiled by src/lib/x-kit/xclient/xclient-internals.make6 so as to have access to internal xclient packages for testing. This is probably a better pattern for large libraries than having all unit tests compiled by src/lib/test/unit-tests.make6, my previous approach.

2010-01-31-23.29.26: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/wire/: Renamed get-server-address.pkg -> crack-xserver-address.pkg, since that is what it turns out to do.

2010-01-31-15.40.05: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/protocol/: Renamed wire-to-xreplies.pkg -> wire-to-value.pkg (more accurate -- it handles X replies, but also X events and X errors).
2010-01-31-15.27.08: src/lib/x-kit/xclient/src/protocol/: Renamed xerrors.pkg -> protocol-errors.pkg.

2010-01-30-14.13.21: src/lib/x-kit/lib/client-interface/: Renamed iccc.pkg -> xselection.pkg for clarity and coherency.

2010-01-24-21.00.39: src/lib/x-kit/widget/leaf/: Renamed pushbutton.pkg -> pushbuttons.pkg and toggleswitch.pkg -> toggleswitches.pkg because they are really collections.
2010-01-24-20.36.59: src/lib/x-kit/widget/: Globally renamed widget_of -> as_widget because it is a coercion, not an element fetch.
2010-01-24-20.24.38: src/lib/x-kit/widget/leaf/: For clarity, renamed button.pkg -> pushbutton.pkg and toggle.pkg -> toggleswitch.pkg.

2010-01-24-19.17.07: src/lib/x-kit/widget/leaf/: Pervasively renamed 'view' -> 'appearance' for clarity, and because 'view' has a conflicting technical meaning nowadays.

2010-01-24-13.42.04: src/lib/x-kit/widget/leaf/button.api: Renamed 'action' field to 'click_callback' because that is what it bloody well is -- why be coy? Also 'dir' -> 'direction'.
2010-01-24-13.25.30: src/lib/x-kit/widget/leaf/button.api: Renamed Arrow_Dir -> Arrow_Direction (etc) for clarity.
2010-01-24-12.26.43: src/lib/x-kit/widget/lib/: Renamed button-set.pkg -> button-group.pkg to conform to contemporary usage, and because it manages a list, not a set.
2010-01-24-12.03.44: src/lib/x-kit/widget/lib/button-set.api: Renamed exception MULTIPLE_CHOICES -> ONLY_ONE_RADIOBUTTON_MAY_BE_ON for clarity; random commenting based on Gansner+Reppy 1993.
2010-01-24-02.11.33: src/lib/x-kit/widget/lib/: Renamed widget-set.pkg -> button-set.pkg because it is mainly about managing radiobuttons and kin. Random related commenting and cleaning.

2010-01-24-00.46.41: src/lib/x-kit/widget/: Moved widget-set.pkg from layout/ -> lib/ because it is not in fact a widget at all. Split off widget-set.api as a separate file for cleanliness.
2010-01-24-00.32.11: src/lib/x-kit/widget/layout/viewport.api: More cleanup and commenting.
2010-01-24-00.09.51: src/lib/x-kit/widget/layout/viewport.api:  Renamed set_orig,set_vert,set_horiz -> set_origin,set_vertical_position,set_horizontal_position for clarity. (One effective way to communicate with an English-speaking audience is -- use English!)
2010-01-23-23.07.53: src/lib/x-kit/widget/node/size-preference-wrapper.api: Additional renaming for clarity, such as widget -> child.
2010-01-23-22.44.21: src/lib/x-kit/widget/node/: Renamed shape-preference-wrapper.pkg -> size-preference-wrapper.pkg for consistency, various internal related renaming.

2010-01-23-14.24.08: src/lib/x-kit/widget/: Renamed layout/pile.pkg -> node/choice-of-widgets.pkg for clarity and parallelism with line-of-widgets. Renamed make_visible -> show because I reserve 'make' for value creation functions. Renamed visible -> showing for consistency with 'show'.
2010-01-23-13.57.24: src/lib/x-kit/widget/: Created node/ because I want to distinguish between child-owning widgets which do/not do nontrivial layout.  Moved background.pkg, border.pkg and shape-constraint.pkg into it.
2010-01-23-13.40.59: src/lib/x-kit/widget/layout/border.api: Renamed make_border { ... widget ... } -> child because that is what it is -- why be coy\?
2010-01-23-13.12.29: src/lib/x-kit/widget/layout/: Renamed frame.pkg -> border.pkg because all the docs and comments describe it as drawing a border -- why not call a spade a spade\?

2010-01-23-11.52.59: src/lib/x-kit/widget/layout/line-of-widgets.api: Added many comments swiped from the Gansner+Reppy 1993 eXene widget manual.
2010-01-22-23.05.02: src/lib/x-kit/widget/layout/line-of-widgets.api: Renamed WBOX to WIDGET because that is what it bloody well is -- why be coy?
2010-01-22-22.41.59: src/lib/x-kit/widget/layout/: Renamed linear-layout.pkg -> line-of-widgets.pkg, for clarity and for consistency with pile-of-widgets.pkg nomenclature. Various related renaming such as GLUE -> SPACER.
2010-01-22-21.39.29: src/lib/x-kit/widget/layout/scrollbar-layout.api: Remove spuriously exported w (widget) package. That sort of empty generalization reduces readability pointlessly.
2010-01-22-20.18.19: src/lib/x-kit/widget/: Renamed compound/ -> layout/ for brevity, clarity, and because the main business of and distinctions between them are their window layout algorithms.

2010-01-16-22.19.13: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/: widget.api, topwindow.api: Various commenting and cleaning. Dropped pretense that Wm_Args is abstract and renamed it to Window_And_Icon_Names, since that is what it in fact is.
2010-01-16-22.19.13: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/: Renamed root.pkg -> root-window.pkg.
2010-01-16-18.15.24: src/lib/x-kit/widget/compound/: Renamed pile.pkg -> pile-of-widgets.pkg for clarity. (Also split off pile-of-widgets.api as a separate file, as usual.)
2010-01-16-17.52.38: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/widget.api: Renamed size_constraint_fn -> size_constraint_thunk_of. (Continued cleanup from last major code transform.)
2010-01-16-17.29.15: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/widget.api: Renamed size_constraint_thunk_of -> size_constraint_of. (Correcting overshoot in previous code transform.)

2010-01-16-14.57.46: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/widget-base.api: Renamed min_dim,nat_dim,max_dim -> minimum_length,preferred_length,maximum_length.
2010-01-16-14.13.08: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/widget-base.api: Renamed fix_dim,flex_dim -> tight_cosntraint,loose_constraint to include 'contraint' tie-noun an improve length symmetry, and because 'flex' suggests bending rather than stretching.
2010-01-15-22.08.45: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/widget-base.api: Renamed INT_CONSTRAINT fields base,step,min,nat,max -> start_at,step_by,min_steps,preferred_steps,max_steps, for clarity.
2010-01-15-21.12.20: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/widget-base.api: Renamed Dim,DIM -> Int_Constraint,INT_CONSTRAINT because that is what they bloody well are. :-)
2010-01-15-20.20.06: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basic/widget-base.api: Rename Bounds -> Widget_Shape_Constraints.
2010-01-15-19.07.48: src/lib/x-kit/graphlib/cartouche.api:  Replaced c_wid,c_ht cryptonym parameters with single corner_radius parameter for clarity, brevity and convenience.
2010-01-15-17.02.51: src/lib/x-kit/lib/iccc/xatom.pkg,atom-imp.pkg: Renamed intern_atom -> make_atom because 'intern' is not a word; renamed lookup_atom -> find_atom because 'lookup' is a noun, not a verb; renamed name_of_atom -> atom_to_string because that is more precise.
2010-01-15-04.32.09: src/lib/x-kit/lib/user/drawing.api: For clarity renamed feedback() -> make_unbuffered_drawable() and create_overlay() -> make_locked_window(). (The latter appears unused and perhaps not fully implemented.)
2010-01-15-03.52.43: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Rename keysym-trans.pkg -> keysym-to-ascii.pkg, inside it rename lookup() -> map_keysym_to_ascii() etc.

2010-01-13-20.06.33: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/pen.pkg: Renamed new_pen() -> make_pen() because 'new' is not a verb, dammit. Also update_pen() -> clone_pen() because it is shorter and clearer.
2010-01-13-19.50.23: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/pen.pkg: Random cleanup.
2010-01-13-18.22.14: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed pen-rep.pkg -> pen-guts.pkg because 'guts' is an honest, pungent Anglo-Saxon word while 'rep' is just the gray shade of a word wanna-be.
2010-01-13-16.14.45: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/window.pkg: Renamed map_window,unmap_window -> show_window,hide_window, because 'map' is a terrible word anyhow, plus it has strong unrelated associations in Mythryl.
2010-01-13-15.16.51: src/lib/x-kit/lib/iccc/iccc-property.pkg: Rename Size_Hints -> Window_Manager_Size_Hint, Window_Manager_Hints -> Window_Manager_Hint.

2010-01-12-23.33.06: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed cursor.pkg -> xcursor.pkg; within renamed Std_Cursor -> Standard_Xcursor etc.
2010-01-12-22.48.46: src/lib/x-kit/: Random low-level cleanup and commenting, mostly in *window.pkg + cursor.pkg.
2010-01-12-16.21.14: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/draw-types.pkg: Renamed Drawable -> Drawable_Window for clarity.
2010-01-12-16.00.25: src/lib/x-kit/: Globally renamed geometry_of_ -> shape_of_ because 'geometry' is way too long relative to frequency of use. (Zipf lives!)

2010-01-12-15.33.24: src/lib/x-kit/widget/lib/readonly-window-cache.pkg: Additional cleanup.

2010-01-12-14.28.54: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed image.pkg -> clientside-window.pkg to work in 'window' tie noun, because 'image' is over-used and vague, and because that is what they in fact are.
2010-01-12-13.32.01: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed tile.pkg -> readonly-window.pkg -- because that is what they in fact are.
2010-01-12-12.44.42: src/lib/x-kit/lib/: Changed mind, 'window' is a better tie-noun than 'pixmap' here. Renamed pixmap/ back to window/.  Renamed window/offscreen-pixmap.pkg -> window/offscreen-window.pkg.
2010-01-12-12.08.47: src/lib/x-kit/lib/: Renamed window/ -> pixmap/.
2010-01-12-11.26.58: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed rw-pixmap.pkg to offscreen-pixmap.pkg. (Decided to use 'pixmap' as the tie noun for drawables.)

2010-01-11-23.16.58: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/draw-types.pkg: Renamed WSRC,PMSRC,TSRC -> FROM_WINDOW,FROM_PIXMAP,FROM_TILE for clarity.
2010-01-11-23.03.52: src/lib/x-kit/lib/user/geometry-2d.api:  WINDOW_GEOMETRY: Renamed 'border' -> 'border_width' for clarity.
2010-01-11-22.45.59: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/xsession.pkg: Commenting and cleaning.
2010-01-11-20.56.02: src/lib/x-kit/lib/user/geometry-2d.api: Renamed bound_box -> bounding_box.  In WINDOW_GEOMETRY renamed pos -> upperleft.
2010-01-11-15.47.02: src/lib/x-kit/lib/user/geometry-2d.api: Renamed origin_of_box,corner_of_box -> upperleft_of_box,lowerright_of_box because there are no points for obscurity in open source.
2010-01-11-15.09.42: src/lib/x-kit/: Renamed graph-util/ -> graphlib/.
2010-01-11-14.45.16: src/lib/x-kit/widget/: Renamed util/ to the more traditional lib/.
2010-01-11-14.27.44: src/lib/x-kit/widget/: Renamed composite/ -> compound/.  Saves a syllable!
2010-01-11-14.13.27: src/lib/x-kit/widget/: Renamed basics/ -> basic/.
2010-01-11-13.55.38: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basics/topwindow.pkg: Rename init() -> start(), because that is what it does, and because 'start' at least is an actual word! :-)
2010-01-11-13.42.22: src/lib/x-kit/widget/basics/: Renamed shell.pkg -> topwindow.pkg, because it has nothing to do with bash or tcsh and everything to do with toplevel application windows.
2010-01-11-12.53.52: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed xtopwwindow-xevent-router-imp.pkg -> xbuf-to-widgettree-xevent-router.pkg. Renamed top-level-window.pkg -> widgettree-root-xevent-router.pkg.
2010-01-11-04.03.45: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed window-lock-imp.pkg -> topwindows-xevent-router-imp.pkg. (Locking turns out to be only a secondary function of this imp.)
2010-01-11-03.06.58: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed keymap.pkg -> keymap-imp.pkg, since it in fact implements an imp.
2010-01-11-02.21.07: src/lib/x-kit/lib/iccc/: Renamed xatoms.pkg -> xatom.pkg. (I reserve plural names for packages implementing collections.)
2010-01-11-01.55.16: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/xsession.pkg: Strip dippy dpy_ prefixes from request* and flush function names.
2010-01-11-01.37.09: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/xsession.pkg: Random cleanup.
2010-01-11-01.01.25: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed display.pkg -> xsession.pkg because the display/xdisplay distinction was confusing, and because it in fact manages the X session.
2010-01-10-23.24.58: src/lib/x-kit/lib/protocol/: Renamed xclient-socket.pkg -> xsocket.pkg etc.
2010-01-10-22.23.32: src/lib/x-kit/example/: Renamed widgets/ -> widget/. src/lib/x-kit/style/: Renamed styles-g.pkg -> style-g.pkg.

2010-01-10-21.36.04: src/lib/x-kit/: Renamed widgets/ -> widget/ because plural directory names are just wasted bandwidth.
2010-01-10-21.09.50: src/lib/x-kit/widgets: Renamed simple/ -> leaf/ for brevity -- and because widget-hierarchy leaf widgets are often far from simple!
2010-01-10-15.48.47: src/lib/x-kit/lib/protocol/: Renamed xcvtfns.pkg -> xprotocol-wire-encoding.pkg -- because that is what the package does! :-)
2010-01-10-13.25.16: src/lib/x-kit/lib/protocol/: Renamed xio.pkg -> xsocket-client.pkg, because what it actually does is manage X client socket I/O.
2010-01-10-03.23.24: src/lib/x-kit/: Even more request -> plea renaming.
2010-01-10-01.38.48: src/lib/x-kit/: Yup, still more request -> plea renaming.
2010-01-09-22.46.38: src/lib/x-kit/: Still more request -> plea renaming.
2010-01-09-22.10.24: src/lib/x-kit/widgets/simple/: Renamed label-bttn-view.pkg -> labelled-button-view.pkg, similarly the pkg.
2010-01-09-20.37.42: src/lib/x-kit/: More request -> plea renaming.
2010-01-09-20.02.29: src/lib/x-kit/: Much renaming of req and request -> plea, for brevity and clarity.
2010-01-09-18.48.25: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed draw-master.pkg -> draw-imp.pkg and pkg draw_master -> draw_imp.

2010-01-05-18.27.39: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg: Generate explanatory headers for tracelog files. No, that is not unixy. But I like non-mysterious.
2010-01-05-18.06.19: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg: Increase print_if timestamp resolution from milliseconds to microseconds. Change ancestors() to return a list of names rather than nodes. (More useful.)

2010-01-05-17.19.50: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg:  Tweaked make_trace_tree_leaf to raise an exception for duplicate node name, instead of returning pre-existing node. Replaced module_of by node_by_name which searches by name rather than full_name (i.e., by local notname instead of by a /path/name).
2010-01-05-16.32.25: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg: Replaced TRACE_TREE_NODE.full_name field with TRACE_TREE_NODE.parent field, killed module_of(), added exported parent() and ancestors() functions.
2010-01-05-15.50.57: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg: Adopt the convention that TRACE_TREE_NODE.label (renamed TRACE_TREE_NODE.name) is foo::tracing or such -- commandline expression for controlling node.
2010-01-05-15.26.15: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg: Adopt the convention that TRACE_TREE_NODE.label (renamed TRACE_TREE_NODE.name) is foo::tracing or such -- commandline expression for controlling node.
2010-01-05-14.48.42: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg: Added timestamping to print_if(); Moved newline generation responsibility from print_if() callers to print_if() itself.
2010-01-05-12.35.00: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.api: Added a long top-of-file OVERVIEW comment section.
2010-01-05-12.35.00: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/tracing.pkg: Renaming for clarity: status -> subtree_nods_and_tracing_flags, set_trace_file (TRACE_TO_FILE foo.log) -> log_trace_messages (TO_FILE foo.log).
2010-01-05-00.26.25: Pervasively renamed varptr -> current_thread_ptr assembly, C and Mythryl source.
2010-01-04-23.43.04: Pervasively renamed varptr -> current_thread_ptr assembly, C and Mythryl source.

2010-01-03-03.18.02: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/: Renamed thread-spy.pkg -> tracing.pkg (etc), since the remaining code now has a clear focus.
2010-01-03-02.59.28: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/: Split off part of thread-spy.pkg to create threadkit-uncaught-exception-reporting.pkg -- that code is unrelated to rest of package and did not belong in there.
2010-01-03-02.34.09: src/lib/src/lib/thread-kit/src/lib/: Split off part of thread-spy.pkg to create thread-deathwatch.pkg -- that code is unrelated to rest of package and did not belong in there.

2010-01-01-19.57.53: src/lib/x-kit:  Rename winreg.pkg -> window-registry.pkg, screen_pt -> screen_point, but -> button ... 
2010-01-01-13.04.53: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/widget-cable.pkg: Rename Trans -> Transition, because the latter is an actual word.
2009-12-31-20.01.06: src/lib/x-kit/lib/window/: Renamed window-dictionary.pkg -> widget-cable.pkg, In_Env -> Kidplug, Out_Env -> Momplug etc.
2009-12-31-17.32.24: Pervasively renamed src,dst -> from,to -- because the Queen's English is not just for the Queen any more! :-)
2009-12-31-16.05.22: src/lib/x-kit/: Pervasively renamed rect to box because box is a vibrant, living word but rect is just the mutilated corpse of a pedanticism.
2009-12-31-05.05.10: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph-view/geometry-2d-float.pkg: Rename RPT -> POINT for clarity, etc.

2009-12-31-00.56.40: src/lib/x-kit/widgets/basics/widget.pkg: Renamed incr -> step because the latter is a word and the former is not.
2009-12-30-21.58.26: src/lib/x-kit: Pervasively renamed macro_expand -> realize, undoing a long-ago global renamed aimed at compiler internals.

2009-12-30-20.54.44: More mk_* -> make_* renaming. Remember, every time you abbreviate, God kills a kitten.

2009-12-30-19.56.22: Rename mk_ to make_ various places.
2009-12-30-15.20.24: Did global rename of *_rect to *_rectangle. (What is it with these creepy word mutilation cults? :-)
2009-12-30-04.03.31: src/lib/x-kit/lib/protocol/: Renamed keybut.pkg to keys-and-buttons.pkg.
2009-12-30-03.32.47: src/lib/x-kit/widgets/simple/scrollbar.pkg: Renamed SCREEN_* -> SCROLL_*.

2009-12-30-01.07.10: src/lib/x-kit/lib/user/geometry-2d.pkg: Renamed y,x -> row,col because that is what they are.
2009-12-29-21.08.02: Renamed src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph-view/geometry-float.pkg -> src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph-view/geometry-2d-float.pkg.
2009-12-29-20.57.56: Renamed src/lib/x-kit/graph-util/rounded-rect.pkg -> src/lib/x-kit/graph-util/cartouche.pkg because that is the correct term.
2009-12-29-20.43.58: Removed src/lib/x-kit/lib/graph-util/* -- these files were all unused, redundant copies of files in src/lib/x-kit/graph-util/.
2009-12-29-20.30.18: Renamed src/lib/x-kit/lib/basics/geometry.pkg -> src/lib/x-kit/lib/user/geometry-2d.pkg.
2009-12-29-00.07.09: src/runtime/o/Makefile.in: $(RUNTIME): Add `pkg-config --libs gtk+-2.0` per Jeffrey Lau.
2009-12-28-23.30.35: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer: Now compiling and exercised by 'make rest' to keep it that way: main/main.pkg, graph-view/graph-view.pkg. (Basically all the examples/ml-viewer/ code is now compiling.)
2009-12-28-21.44.56: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/text-view: Renamed viewer.pkg -> ml-source-code-viewer.pkg.
2009-12-28-18.35.29: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer: Now compiling and exercised by 'make rest' to keep it that way: in util/: get-mouse-selection.pkg; in text-view/: text-display.pkg, approximate-ml.lex, scroll-viewer.pkg, viewer.pkg, text-canvas.pkg, view-buffer.pkg, load-file-g.pkg, ml-viewer.pkg; in graph-view/: graph-viewer.pkg. (That was a thrash!)
2009-12-24-19.31.02: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph-view: view-font.pkg and dotgraph-to-planargraph.pkg now compiling and exercised by 'make rest' to keep it that way.
2009-12-24-14.30.57: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph-view/planar-subgraph-tree.pkg: Now compiling and exercised by 'make rest' to keep it that way.
2009-12-24-11.54.33: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph: dot-graph.grammar, dot-graph.lex and dot-subgraph-tree.pkg now compile, and 'make rest' exercises them. (That was a thrash!)
2009-12-19-20.59.26: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph/dot-graph-io-g.pkg now compiles, and 'make rest' exercises it to make sure it stays compiling.
2009-12-19-20.15.40: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph/dot-graph.grammar now compiles, and 'make rest' exercises it to make sure it stays compiling.
2009-12-19-19.47.05: Renamed float::trunc to float::truncate, although there is a certain perverse irony in truncating the world truncate itself...
2009-12-19-19.32.33: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph-view/geometry-float.pkg now compiles, and 'make rest'' exercises it to make sure it stays compiling.
2009-12-19-19.02.30: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph/dot-subgraph-tree-attributes.pkg now compiles, and 'make rest' exercises it to make sure it stays compiling.
2009-12-19-18.50.30: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph/attributed-subgraph-tree-g.pkg now compiles, and 'make rest' exercises it to make sure it stays compiling.
2009-12-17-13.23.28: Got src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph/subgraph-tree-g.pkg to compile, partly by dint of rewriting it to use red-black trees instead of splaytrees. To keep it compiling, created a build-ml-viewer script and added it to 'make rest'. This means the complete ml-viewer example/app is maybe 5-10% of the way to compiling.
2009-12-15-10.18.35: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph-view/save/ and also all *.sav files under ml-viewer/.
2009-12-15-09.55.44: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/util/mlyacc-base.pkg -- how many copies of this do we need?
2009-12-14-18.37.06: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph/: Renamed attribute_graph* -> attributed_graph* per comments found in src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/GRAPHS.OVERVIEW.  Low-level cleanup on both .api and -g.pkg files.
2009-12-13-21.24.37: Low-level code cleanup throughout src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph/.
2009-12-13-18.44.47: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph/mlyacc-base.pkg -- another ml-yacc implementation file just floating around. Random cleanup in src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/graph/.
2009-12-13-13.47.45: Deleted entire src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/data/src/ directory, which appeared to contain primarily (only?) a redundant, unmaintained copy of ml-yacc.
2009-12-13-12.28.25: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/lib-base.pkg:  It was just an ancestral version of src/lib/src/lib-base.pkg.
2009-12-12-21.30.26: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/: Deleted static-array.api + lib-sg.pkg, both uninteresting scraps of dead code.
2009-12-12-21.20.09: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/string-covnersion.pkg:  Ancient implementations of atoi &tc -- stuff much better done these days using scanf or whatever.
2009-12-12-21.08.25: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/time-limit.pkg:  A 20-line package nowhere used whose functionality is subsumed by the threadkit timeout_in mailop and such.
2009-12-12-20.56.47: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/: Deleted unix-path.pkg + pathnamee.pkg: stdlib already has quite enough of this kind of functionality.
2009-12-12-20.46.02: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/makestring.pkg:  It provided simple formatting of ints and floats as strings, but newer packages like sfprintf do the same thing much better.
2009-12-12-20.33.33: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/hash-string.pkg:  A later version of the same code is available from src/lib/x-kit/lib/util/hash-util.pkg and the same functionality is available from src/lib/src/hash-string.pkg.
2009-12-12-20.20.23: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/: Deleted binary-dict.pkg + binary-set.pkg -- the same Stephen Adams binary tree code that stdlib already has in src/lib/src/binary-map-g.pkg, src/lib/src/binary-set-g.pkg &tc &tc.
2009-12-12-20.01.20: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/hash-table.pkg:  It was just an earlier version of src/lib/src/monomorphic-hash-table-g.pkg.
2009-12-12-19.49.28: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/poly-hash-table.pkg:  It was just an earlier version of src/lib/src/hash-table.pkg.
2009-12-12-18.52.13: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/: Deleted intset.pkg + intmap.pkg -- they were just ancestral versions of src/lib/src/int-binary-set.pkg + src/lib/src/int-binary-map.pkg.
2009-12-12-18.42.23: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/key-set.api:  It appeared nearly identical to src/lib/src/set.api.
2009-12-12-18.32.43: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/random.pkg:  It appeared to be an ancestral version of src/lib/src/rand.pkg.
2009-12-12-18.14.40: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/queue.pkg:  It was a straight clone of src/lib/src/queue.pkg.
2009-12-12-17.59.02: Installed src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/list-util.pkg as src/lib/src/list-fns.pkg because it appears to be useful functionality not already present in stdlib.
2009-12-12-17.16.48: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/list-to-string.pkg:  It was just the ancestral version of src/lib/src/list-to-string.pkg + src/lib/src/string-to-list.pkg.
2009-12-12-17.06.36: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/list-mergesort.pkg:  It was nearly identical to src/lib/src/list-mergesort.pkg.
2009-12-12-16.55.40: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/list-sort.api:  It was a straight clone of src/lib/src/list-sort.api.
2009-12-12-16.45.30: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/fifo.pkg:  It was nearly identical to src/lib/src/fifo.pkg.
2009-12-12-16.24.06: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/hash-key.api:  It was a straight clone of src/lib/src/hash-key.api.
2009-12-12-16.11.42: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/name.pkg:  Did not do anything not already done by src/lib/src/quickstring*pkg.
2009-12-12-12.53.28: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/iterate.pkg:  It was identical to src/lib/src/iterate.pkg. The latter was not being compiled into stdlib, so fixed that too.
2009-12-12-12.00.22: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/matrix.pkg:  It was identical to src/lib/src/matrix.pkg.
2009-12-11-14.56.50: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/key.api:  It was just an early version of src/lib/src/key.api.
2009-12-11-14.41.56: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/format.pkg: Looked like a very early version of the code in src/lib/src/sfprintf.pkg + src/lib/src/scanf.pkg (and thence sprintf() &tc).
2009-12-11-14.31.58: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/dynamic-array.pkg: It was essentially identical to src/lib/src/expanding-rw-vector.pkg in stdlib.
2009-12-11-14.20.28: Deleted src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/rw-vector-quicksort.pkg: It was essentially identical to src/lib/src/rw-vector-quicksort-g.pkg in stdlib.
2009-12-11-02.39.58: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/charset.pkg: This contained functionality not in stdlib: Cleaned it up and moved to stdlib.
2009-12-11-01.46.46: src/lib/x-kit/examples/ml-viewer/library/ctype.pkg: This contained functionality not in stdlib: Split into int-ctype.pkg + string-ctype.pkg and moved to stdlib.
2009-12-10-05.51.48: src/lib/x-kit/examples/widgets/widgets.make6 now compiles, added it to 'make rest' to keep it doing so.
2009-12-10-04.23.39: src/lib/x-kit/examples/triangle/tri.make6 now compiles, added it to 'make rest' to keep it doing so.
