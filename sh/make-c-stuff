# Install-time script to do initial build of
# compiler, libraries and related tools as
# specified in etc/bundles-to-build.
#
# We're typically invoked from the root Makefile as "sh/make-c-stuff"
# in response to a top-level "make compiler" command.
#
# As soon as we have a system capable of executing compiled Mythryl,
# we pass control to sh/build.d/build.pkg via the wrapper
# sh/build.d/unix-build.pkg.
#
# To get to that point, we must:
#
# o  Patch the various sh/_* scripts to suit the host system,
#    and install the patched versions in bin/
#
# o  Compile the Mythryl runtime from the C source code 
#    under src/c/ and install it as bin/mythryl-runtime-ia32. 
#
#    (The runtime provides compiled Mythryl code with various
#    low-level services such as garbage collection,
#    basic Unix I/O, and loading of compiled Mythryl code
#    from .compiled and .frozen files.)
#
# o  Unpack the precompiled Mythryl code in seed-libraries.tgz.
#    (This gets us around the chicken-and-egg problem of how to
#    do the first compile of a compiler written in itself,
#    and is done by 'unpack_seed_libraries:' in Makefile.)
